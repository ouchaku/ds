The second group is the mantid slash gray group.\r\n(0:01:44)"}),(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"And this would involve not only the mantids but also the short grays and the tall grays.

An ancient and advanced human group.\r\n(0:02:37)"}),(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Now Richard writes, in terms of attitude and actions, there doesn't appear to be any hostility coming from this group. The approach seems to have been to standoffishly monitor human activity. And here Richard points to the outstanding work of someone named Dr. Colleen Clements, who has since passed. She was a friend of Richard's for about a decade, I think.\r\nShe worked both at the University of Rochester and the Rochester Institute of Technology. And this is what Richard says about her. Quote, Dr. Colleen Clements argued that humans are a hybrid race.\r\n(0:03:09)"}),(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Our species, she suggested, was probably genetically enhanced by extraterrestrials sometime around 40,000 years ago. She based her case on several factors, the two most prominent being genetic and mythological. The genetic argument comes down to something known as the D allele of our microcephaline gene. The microcephaline gene turns out to be crucial for the development and size of our brain.\r\n(0:03:38)"}),(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Genes have parts of them known as alleles, and the particular allele known as the D allele of that gene is very important to our story, to the story of modern human beings.

Again, it varies exactly when. It could be as few as 10,000, 12,000 years ago, up to 50,000 years ago. There seems to be evidence that 40,000 is a fair number to pick, and that's what Richard does. And so if interbreeding is responsible for this gene, the question is, where does this come from? Where did we inherit this from? And initially, the thoughts were it would be either the Neanderthals or a group that was later identified around 2008, which is the Denisovans. What's interesting is, so far, we have not found that gene in either of those groups.\r\n(0:04:54)"}),(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"And there's been a lot of work done on both of them. And yet, we have not found that there. So that means perhaps it didn't come from there. And if that's the case, it come from somewhere else. So perhaps there's a fourth human group that has not been identified yet.\r\n(0:05:10)"}),(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"But what Dr. Colleen Clements is suggesting and hypothesizing is this could be an extraterrestrial source, and that this happened about 40,000 years ago. So that's the genetic part. Notice we also said key to this hypothesis is the mythological component. This is what this is about. So even prior to the Gilgamesh, much epic, much older than that, there was a Mongolian truth story, a creation story, about a skydiver god known as Erlik Khan. And the idea is that this figure, a godlike figure, came from the sky and was responsible for this gift to human beings.\r\n(0:05:47)"}),(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"And so that might be the mythological interpretation of this event that actually happened in human history. Let's move on to the second major group that Richard identifies in his book, the alien agendas. This is the mantid slash gray group. And interestingly, Richard has grouped these together.

That's an easy motivation to understand, whether it be for profit in some way or simply as a perceived measure of self-defense from a volatile and potentially dangerous species.\r\nHe's referring to us there.

Now, just to touch on something Richard said here again, quote, he said, some reachers don't see this group as malevolent, but any group that engages in a massive program with such a degree of deep secrecy should cause rational people to be suspicious at the very least.\r\n(0:08:42)"}),(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Now, I understand that thinking, that mentality. I think it is rational in a way you can look at it that way. But I also would argue that you could say rationally, we are an incredibly self-destructive species and we pose a danger to ourselves and potentially to others.

Stories of abductions by reptilians do exist, but are not as common as those that include graves.\r\n(0:11:37)"}),(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"They can be frightening, and it's not clear that they are friendly. They may or may not be hostile. Unquote. Now, there's a lot to swallow with this reptilian group. Some people just offhand reject this group because they just look so bizarre, and people have a hard time picturing these giant lizards walking around that look kind of humanoid, muscular, but scaly, lizard-like skin.\r\n(0:12:05)"}),(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Very intimidating, sounds like bad science fiction to some people, and yet there are many, many accounts that attest to people having experiences with this group. So we have to look into it. And then there's the issue of the U.S. military's involvement. What is that about? We'll touch on that later as well.\r\nFor now, let's move on to the next group.\r\n(0:12:26)"}),(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"That is the separate short humanoid group known as the Evens. We'll just touch on this briefly because there's less information about this group. Richard writes, to start with, there may not be a single type of these beings.\r\nThe physical varieties reported seem to preclude that. A number of these entities were reported as looking very similar to greys, with large bald heads, and generally short of stature.\r\n(0:12:48)"}),(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Only the lack of large black eyes prevents us from lumping them into the category of short greys.\r\nYet they seem to be a distinct group from the greys. Other variations have been reported, including some that seem dubious. One example is the very hairy short humanoids reported during the wave of sightings in South America in 1954. Also, if they really are separate from the greys, it's difficult to ascertain their agenda or motives.\r\n(0:13:18)"}),(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Stories of Evens living as guests of the U.S. government exist, going right back to crash retrieval stories of the 1940s and 1950s. These may or may not be grey aliens. There is a lot of smoke here, but that smoke makes it very difficult to see clearly. Moving on from the Evens group, which, as Richard pointed out, is difficult to pin down, his fifth grouping is sort of a meta group.\r\n(0:13:46)"}),(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"One or more additional groups have been reported, people have had experiences with, but they don't fit any of the above. Then finally, there's the sixth group. This is the trickster intelligence. This is what Richard has to say about this group. Quote, we have only had a limited discussion of this possibility.\r\n(0:14:04)"}),(0,n.jsx)(t.hr,{}),(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Another way I sometimes characterize this is as a meta intelligence. By this, I mean there appears at times to be an intelligence operating in our world that is of such a high order that it seems to be prescient. And Richard continues, it operates in ways that seem uncanny and many moves ahead of us at every step.\r\n(0:14:27)"}),(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The phenomena recorded at the Skinwalker Ranch, some of the most baffling 411 missing persons cases investigated by David Paulides, or the synchronicities reported by Mike Cleland in his Messenger's books speak to this. Many of these cases make it appear that there is a crossover between some of the UFO phenomenon with other parts of our reality, including the mysteries of consciousness, dimensions, time, death, and the afterlife.\r\n(0:14:52)"}),(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"So just as we discussed last week, here Richard is pointing to various elements of high strangeness, different categories of high strangeness that might somehow all be connected, points of convergence.\r\nHe mentioned consciousness, dimensions, time, death, and the afterlife.\r\nNow what I would say about this trickster intelligence is that, first of all, it doesn't appear to be extraterrestrial. There's no sign that it's, you know, tied to that necessarily.\r\n(0:15:25)"}),(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"That doesn't mean it's not the case, but it doesn't seem to be that way.\r\nThere's evidence that going far back into human history, even Indian tribes in the area of Skinwalker Ranch reported seeing this entity and entities far back in history, and that's where the name originally came from. And while it's the case that usually technology is involved in somehow interacting with us on Earth, perhaps from some other place, it also occurs to me that there may be groups that have an evolutionary ability to what I call dimension hop.\r\n(0:16:06)"}),(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"They just, even at an early point in their history, might be able to transverse the barriers between what we consider dimensions or different worlds. And that might be what's happening with this entity slash entities.\r\nAnd this may also indicate they're not necessarily that advanced morally, ethically, and such and such. But they nevertheless have the ability to dimension hop, to interact with us in bizarre and uncanny ways.\r\n(0:16:41)"}),(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Now that we've identified the six major groups that Richard points to, the six major agendas that can be identified, let's jump to a discussion of the broad strokes. The groups that are supposedly here to help versus those maybe who are here to harm. And some people see the same group differently, and Richard acknowledges that. Regarding the here to help perspective, this is what Richard has to say.\r\n(0:17:05)"}),(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Judging from the types of evidence and claims that exist among people with alleged alien contact, it seems possible that there are aliens who want to help us. Of course, we could ask, how could they really help us? That is very likely easier said than done. Given the fact that we have a large number of UFO sighting reports, declassified military documents, and private accounts of UFO events near nuclear locations, it surely seems that someone is concerned about our nuclear technology.\r\n(0:17:37)"}),(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Moreover, if you care to believe the many messages that abductees and contactees tell us, these beings believe that humans are making a wreck of the world via nuclear dangers, warfare, environmental degradation, low levels of consciousness, and that we are about to experience a great change. This message comes through repeatedly, not only from the human-looking beings, but also from the greys and other types.\r\n(0:18:04)"}),(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Now again, to clarify, Richard makes it clear in his book that he thinks the evidence of ancient aliens is not that of greys or mantids. He thinks both of these groups are more recently on the scene, within the last century or so, or at least since the beginning of the 20th century. And I would agree with what Richard has to say here, and I'd add that while reports regarding possible interactions with UFOs from ancient history do exist, Richard makes a compelling data-backed case, suggesting there has been a massive uptick in interactions, perhaps even in a number of groups here since the dawn of the atomic age.\r\n(0:18:39)"}),(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Again, those two newer groups being, at least anyway, the mantids and the greys.\r\n(0:18:44)"}),(0,n.jsx)(t.hr,{}),(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"So that covers the broad strokes regarding the perspective that some of these groups are here to help, that even the greys and mantids are actually here to help. And we've touched on some of the reasons why that might be the case. The huge uptick in experiences, sightings since the dawn of the atomic age, for instance.\r\n(0:19:08)"}),(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Of course, there is an alternate perspective, an opposing perspective, that sees this completely differently. This group of people are convinced that the greys and mantids and groups such as them have ill will towards human beings and do not have our best interests in mind. And Richard definitely makes note of this perspective as well. And he discusses David Jacobs' planetary takeover hypothesis.\r\n(0:19:33)"}),(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"And Jacobs is probably the most well-known proponent of this idea that greys and mantids are here not to help, but to harm, and to see their own goals met. And his hypothesis, just to clarify for those who are not familiar with his work, is based on his own regressions that he's done of his clients. He does hypnotic regressions on clients who claim to have been abducted by aliens, and then draws conclusions based on the data that he feels he's gathered over time.\r\n(0:20:03)"}),(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"This is what Richard has to say about this kind of perspective. The best known exponent of the alien hybrid idea is Dr. David Jacobs. He boils down their program to two words, planetary takeover. Jacobs came to this conclusion, he wrote, due to the consistency of the many abductees he worked with, many of whom described ongoing relationships with the human-looking hybrids, whom he termed hubrids, over the last few decades.\r\n(0:20:28)"}),(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"As he has seen it, the point is to create ever more human-looking hybrids through an ongoing process of refinement, getting the end result to look almost perfectly human, while enabling the hybrid to retain the core mental features of the alien race. The main feature seems to be telepathy and the ability to exert mind control over ordinary humans. His conclusion, this is referring to, is that the abduction process is common and worldwide.\r\n(0:21:01)"}),(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Moreover, it is being undertaken with the greatest level of stealth possible. Abductees report that their hybrid hubrid controllers have sometimes hinted to them of an impending great change, although the specifics of this change are never provided. Jacobs has interpreted it as a takeover of our world by stealth. That is, until it's too late.\r\n(0:21:30)"}),(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Now, I have some of my own perspectives on Jacob's work and Jacob's conclusions. But before we get to that, let's look at what Richard has to say.\r\nFor all the power of Jacob's research and thesis, my own conclusion is that he may well be correct, but incomplete in describing the bigger picture. By Jacob's own research, true hubrids are a very recent development, definitely not earlier than toward the close of the 20th century, maybe the 1980s at the earliest.\r\n(0:21:59)"}),(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"But there are many cases of perfectly human-looking beings engaged in these flying saucers long before. What accounts for them?\r\n(0:22:04)"}),(0,n.jsx)(t.hr,{}),(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"I don't think this was something Jacob's really ever asked. No matter how great a researcher he may be, it is so easy to overlook inconvenient evidence.\r\nRichard's making a really important point here, and I made a very similar point last week in the inaugural edition of this podcast. We must make account for all of the data, not just the segments of the data that support our predetermined hypotheses.\r\n(0:22:34)"}),(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"And by the way, that absolutely goes for me too. I have certain leanings at this point, to be sure. The centrality of consciousness to both understanding the nature of reality and of the phenomenon, for instance, but I will continue to look as honestly as I can at the evidence we garner, all of it. And there is no doubt that while it is not the majority, there is a segment of experiencers who report negative interactions. And this is even after having had time to process and reevaluate the experience over years. I must make account for that just as anyone else must with their hypothesis.\r\n(0:23:07)"}),(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Now, regarding David Jacob's work and the conclusions he has drawn after having worked with clients and doing regressions for years and years and years, I would just add to the discussion the figure of Barbara Lamb. Barbara Lamb is mentioned in Richard's book, though somewhat in passing. But for the record, though it's not stated starkly in the book, it should be noted that Lamb came to precisely the opposite conclusions as Jacob's after considering her body of work.\r\n(0:23:45)"}),(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"And just to be clear, she's done just as many, if not more, regressions than Jacob's, including on Dolan's own wife, Tracy, for instance. And that experience is actually discussed in the book. I once saw an interview with Barbara Lamb where she mentioned that she had reached out to Jacob's in order to facilitate a shared review of their respective data, but that Jacob's didn't respond.\r\n(0:24:07)"}),(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"And that's exactly what I'm talking about. It doesn't do us any justice. It doesn't do this cause, this subject, this inquiry, any justice if we don't consider all the evidence. And you would think that Jacob's would at least be interested in why Barbara Lamb would have come to such different conclusions after having done just as many, if not more, regressions than him.\r\n(0:24:29)"}),(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"If a researcher is really open to the data and not committed to a predetermined position, they should always be willing to review the evidence with other researchers.\r\nNow, Dolan's book touches on other aspects of the alien history on Earth as well, though we don't have the time to go into all of those.\r\n(0:24:49)"}),(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Let's jump to some of Dolan's conclusions. In a section called Cover-Up, Competition, and Collusion, this is what Dolan has to say. Quote, whoever and whatever these aliens are, wherever they have ultimately come from, it is evident that they are both human and non-human in appearance. They don't necessarily share the same agenda. Judging by the number of sightings worldwide, even after accounting for cases of mistaken identity, they are here in large numbers.\r\n(0:25:19)"}),(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"This means they have some sort of active infrastructure, which in turn probably has the protection of the various governments of the world. Now, regarding the fact that many of the key groups, the Mantids, the Greys, etc., are here only recently, when you think about it, just a blink of an eye in terms of Earth history.\r\n(0:25:40)"}),(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"This is what Dolan has to say. Quote, but to my mind, the idea of a low-key alien presence for most of our history makes perfect sense. The plain fact is that for most of our history, we were not that interesting. However, we might well have been monitored for our future potential. Consider human society back then, a society utilizing primitive muscle power technology, one that only invented writing and the wheel a mere 6,000 years ago, and which only developed science a couple of centuries ago.\r\n(0:26:08)"}),(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Anywhere on the planet, human society was one in which people did the muscle work themselves, or at most had animals pulling wooden carts and plows. Now, I would add that while I see Dolan's point here, the problem I see with this kind of reasoning in particular is that it applies human psychology to an alien intelligence, and we just have no idea whether or not that would really apply.\r\n(0:26:34)"}),(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"We just don't know what they would find quote-unquote interesting. In fact, there are some who have stated that it is human emotion and drama that some intelligences actually feed on, and there has certainly been plenty of that to go around over the course of human history.\r\n(0:26:48)"}),(0,n.jsx)(t.hr,{}),(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"But Richard's point about the monumental shift humanity has undergone over the last 100 years is well taken. Just think about it. In the span of about 100 years, we've gone from horses and buggies, to aircraft, to spacecraft, to the imminent plans for colonization of Mars. I also agree that there seems to have been an explosion of interest in interaction since the dawn of the atomic age, and the interest UFO intelligence or intelligences has in our nuclear facilities and arsenal is, I would argue, undeniable at this point.\r\n(0:27:33)"}),(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Now, why would they be so interested in our arsenal and our nuclear technologies? For our own benefit? To prevent us from blowing up ourselves?\r\nQuite possibly, that's a huge part of it. But there might be more than that involved.\r\nThere has been some discussion amongst those who claim to have been in contact with non-human intelligence that nuclear explosions of this magnitude have ripple effects, inter-dimensionally even. In other words, even beyond the threat nuclear weapons pose to ourselves, they may pose a new and daunting threat to the larger neighborhood.\r\n(0:28:10)"}),(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Now, some may find this idea laughable. How would nuclear explosions have ripple effects inter-dimensionally? Perhaps it's not even that.\r\nPerhaps it's just about the larger biosphere on Earth that we just don't fully understand yet.\r\nIt's very clear. There seems to be evidence that there are other species here.\r\nOnes that can be stealthy, but nevertheless here.\r\n(0:28:31)"}),(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"And as Richard has pointed out, they may even live underground, subterranean bases, for instance. And of course, groups like that would be very concerned with our nuclear technology. So I've covered much of Richard's perspectives on these alien agendas, and I've given some response to those perspectives as well. Something else I wanted to touch on before we close.\r\n(0:28:56)"}),(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Richard writes regarding the reptilians, quote, but they are presumably looking out for their own interests as all species can be expected to do, unquote. Now, I actually take issue with this. My perspective is that evolution leads to a sense of oneness. Again, the working hypothesis I'm working with is that this oneness doctrine, this shared consciousness, this one root consciousness behind reality, is something that I think some of these other species understand more than we do.\r\n(0:29:27)"}),(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"And that this perspective leads to ever-expanding circles of inclusion, so that me-ness, quote-unquote, and we-ness expands, so that they don't see us and them the same way that we do. Harming you is harming me, in other words, is the perspective I think many of these species are working with.\r\nI think that this is what happens as the evolutionary process unfolds.\r\n(0:29:53)"}),(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"If you even look at human history, it's very clear that that's been the case, going from me-centric perspectives to tribal, to nation-states, to now more planetary perspectives on consciousness and inclusion. And I think we'll bring it to a close here. This is a huge topic. It's a lot for Richard to cover in one book, and he's done a fantastic job.\r\n(0:30:21)"}),(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"I encourage you to get a hold of the book and read it for yourself. Come to your own conclusions. Interact with the different perspectives and the data.
