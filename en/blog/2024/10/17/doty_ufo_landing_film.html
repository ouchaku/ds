<p>Richard Doty は「Holloman 空軍基地に着陸した UFO の動画」が捏造だと百も承知で、いまだに情報撹乱工作に励んでいる。</p>
<p>これが捏造であることは過去記事、

<p>で詳しく説明した。Linda Moulton Howe を筆頭に、Gran Cameron のような UFO 研究者までもこの情報撹乱工作を真に受けている。2022-09-14 の収録動画。</p>

<p>休憩に入る前に話を戻してもいいですか？リンダのHBOのドキュメンタリーに空軍が載せたくないものがあると言っていましたね。それは何ですか？
(1:27:14)</p>
<hr>
<p>それは、1974年にホロマン空軍基地に着陸する前に起こった事件について彼女が話していたことでした。ケビン・エッガーは彼女にフィルムを見せるつもりだったらしい。リンダは政府が誰にも見せたくないものにアクセスしていた。まだ機密扱いだった。それをHBOが持っていた。そしてHBOはそれを諜報関係者に引き渡したんだ。
(1:27:49)</p>
<p>HBOは何を持っていたのですか？フィルムを持っていたのか？
実はオリジナルのフィルムを持っていたんだ。
本当に？
ええ。その一部が流出したんだ。つまり、15秒の50秒だったかな。
ええ、ええ、私たちはみんなそれを見たわ。でも、実際のところは......つまり、数分なんだ。33分だった。
UFO学の聖杯だ。
(1:28:18)</p>
<p>私は何人かの人と話をしました。1人はコピーを見た人、もう1人は実物を見た人、今、Mとエッガーのプロジェクトに関わったプロデューサーやその他に話を聞きました。でもそれは聖杯でしょう？オリジナルのフィルムはどこにあるんですか？
ああ、それは......見たよ。まあ、33分は見てないけど。
もちろん、15秒のものは見たよ。
(1:28:44)</p>
<p>それから、7分7分だったかな。正確な長さは覚えていない。10分もなかった。確か7秒か7分だったと思う。
つまり、着陸するところと、宇宙船から出てくる生き物を映していたんだ。
軍関係者との面会は映っていないけど、それ以外の26分間にそれについて話した人たちがいるからね。
(1:29:17)</p>
<p>つまり、ハル・プソフにはその一部始終を見た友人がいて、異常だと思ったし、1964年の事件だから政府が作ったものではないと知っていた。それで政府は望みをかなえた。つまり、作戦は成功した。彼らはそれを取り戻した。
リンダはどうしたんだ？リンダとは話したことがない。彼女は見たのか？
(1:29:44)</p>
<p>分からない。彼女に聞いてみないと。
ホロマンフィルムを見たHBOの幹部は、UFO学以外の一般人がこれを見たのですか？まあ、私が言えることは、彼らが持っていることを知っていたということです。誰が見たかは知りませんが、私は知っていましたし、それは私の作戦ではありませんでした。ニューヨークとワシントンで働いていた諜報員たちだ。だから私は、彼らがそこでやっていたことのすべてにアクセスすることはできなかった。

You mentioned that there was something that was supposed to be in Linda&#x27;s HBO documentary that the Air Force didn&#x27;t want in there. What was that?
(1:27:14)</p><hr><p>It was the it was she was talking about an incident that happened prior to the 1974 landing at Holloman Air Force Base. Kevin Egger supposedly was going to gave her saw the film. Linda had access to something that the government didn&#x27;t want anybody to see. It was still classified. HBO had it. And then HBO turned it over to some of our intelligence people.
(1:27:49)</p><p>What did HBO have? Did they have film or did they have?
They actually had the original film.
Really?
Yeah. And some of it has leaked out. I mean, that there&#x27;s there&#x27;s a 15 second 50, I believe it was 15 seconds.
Yeah, yeah, we&#x27;ve all seen that. But the actual real I mean, that&#x27;s the minutes. It was 33 minutes.
Yeah, that&#x27;s the Holy Grail of ufology.
(1:28:18)</p><p>I&#x27;ve talked to a couple of people that one that saw a copy of another one that saw the actual now talk to the producers and and and stuff that were involved in M and Eggers project. But that&#x27;s the Holy Grail, right? Where is the original film?
Yeah, that&#x27;s I mean, I&#x27;ve seen it. Well, I haven&#x27;t seen the 33 minutes.
I saw that, of course, a 15 second one you can look at.
(1:28:44)</p><p>And then I saw the I think it was seven seven minutes or something. I can&#x27;t remember exactly how long it was. It was less than 10 minutes. I believe it was seven seconds, seven minutes, which was extraordinary.
I mean, it showed the landing and showed the creatures coming out of the spaceship.
That doesn&#x27;t show the meeting with the military people, but because that&#x27;s on the other the rest of the 26 minutes that there&#x27;s people that talked about it.
(1:29:17)</p><p>I mean, I know that Hal Puthoff had a friend that saw the whole thing and thought it was extraordinary and knew it wasn&#x27;t made by the government because it was, you know, a 1964 incident. And so the government got what they wanted. I mean, the operation was successful. They got it back.
And what did Linda? I&#x27;ve never talked to Linda about this. Did she see it?
(1:29:44)</p><p>I&#x27;m not sure. You&#x27;d have to ask her.
Executives at HBO that saw the Holloman film that there are civilians out there outside of ufology that have seen this? Well, all I can say is I knew they had it. I don&#x27;t know if you know who saw it, but I knew and that wasn&#x27;t my operation. It was the agents that were working in New York area and Washington. So I didn&#x27;t have access to everything that they were doing there, but they got the film back.

<ul>
<li>2:38:00 Project Serpo について。事実が含まれいてるはずだ。</li>
</ul>
<p>セルポ 誤報だ 偽情報だ 政府のキャンペーンだ 何だったんだ？</p>
<hr>
<p>それは...</p>
<hr>
<p>イエスかノーで答えろ 両方だ</p>
<hr>
<p>この話は... 複雑な話なんだ。
ビクター・マルティネス、ジョー・イェーガー、そして...。(2:37:28)そして、その選手たちの名前を挙げればきりがない。
(2:37:28)</p>
<p>それから私は、他の人たちから情報を得たり供給したりしていた。
もちろん、当時はまだ僕はいなかった。私は子供だった。
でも、そのことを誓う人もいる。
そして、ロシアを怖がらせるための偽情報キャンペーンだったと言う人もいる。私たちが地球外生命体と接触したとロシア人に思わせ、ロシア人を怖がらせたかったのです。それは事実だと思う。私たちはロシア人に知らせたと思う。
(2:38:18)</p>
<p>しかし一方で、起こったことを検証できることもたくさんある。
残念なことに、彼らは死んでしまった。
でも、それが起こったことを心から語った人がいる。
何人行ったのか、12人だったのか、3人だったのか、1人だったのか、論争があるけれどね。
リンダ・ハウエルがセルポについて、あるいは彼女が知っていることについて、そして行ったとされる1人の人物について、何度も話していたことは知っている。
(2:39:01)</p>
<p>そして戻ってきた。だから、ほとんど防諜活動であるバケツの中に、ちょっとした事実があるのだと思う。
なぜ彼らは、失礼ですが、このようなことでロシアを欺こうとしたのでしょうか。ロシアに、私たちがセルポという惑星に人材を派遣し、交換していると信じさせたのでしょうか。
つまり、ロシア人がそんな話を 信じて何の得があるというのか？
(2:39:47)</p>
<p>まあ、それには様々な側面がある。
第一に、もし我々が地球外生命体と接触したとロシア人が信じるなら、それは地球外生命体が我々に高度な武器や高度な研究技術を提供している可能性があることを意味する。そうなればロシアは怖がるだろう。第一に、我々は武器システムや宇宙旅行に関して、彼らが持っていないものを持っていると考えるだろう。
(2:40:24)</p>
<p>そして60年代のロシアは、スパイを意味する人的情報に関していくらか優位に立っていた。我々は開かれた社会を持っていた。彼らはそうではなかった。彼らにとって自国民を追跡するのは簡単だった。我々にとっては、スパイを把握するのは容易ではなかった。
諜報活動のコースでは、歴史を学ぶんだ。
(2:41:01)</p>
<p>私たちが学んだことの一つは、50年代から60年代にかけて、ソビエトは私たちのスパイを追跡するのが簡単だったということです。そして我々は、ソ連のスパイを追跡するのは難しい仕事だった。だから、私たちはあなたたちが持っていないものを持っているんだ、ということにつながったんだと思う。それも作戦の一部だと思う。事実はわからないけれどね。CIRPLがアメリカの諜報機関にとって何か意味があるのは知っている。
(2:41:44)</p>
<p>CIRPLという言葉は、特別な地球外惑星か何かと関係がある。CIRPLには実際の意味があり、それは少し前にここで明らかになったばかりだ。誰かが僕の知らないことを教えてくれたんだ。つまり、CIRPL文書の情報公開は可能だと？うーん 試した人はいる。DIAがビル・ライアンに公開した ドキュメントがあります 彼は... 管理者です。それはCIRPLに 関する情報を持っていたが、かなり編集されていた。
(2:42:36)</p>
<p>実際には、それはCIRPLに関するものではなく、プロジェクト・クリスタル・ナイトに関するものでした。覚えています。CIRPLとは何の関係もなかった。その文書はクリスタルナイトに関するもので、国家安全保障局によって運営されていた宇宙計画でした。でも、その文書はかなり墨消しされていたから、そこから多くのことを読み取ることはできなかった。
(2:43:09)</p>
<hr>
<p>CIRPLの話から私が得た唯一のものは、ビル・ライアンのものでした。彼はそれを私に見せ、他の人にも見せて、私が行間を読めるかどうか知りたがった。でも、あまりに冗長で、何が書いてあるのかわからないんだ。
(2:43:39)</p>
<p>さて、番組の冒頭で、プロジェクト・ブルーブックは正真正銘の偽情報、誤報キャンペーンであると述べました。私は、歴史はこのままその道を進んでいくと思います。あなたにとって、UFOに関して空軍がアメリカ国民に直接誤った情報を流した最高の証拠ですか？
ああ、そうだね、最初はプログラムだったと思う。
(2:44:12)</p>
<p>怨恨』から『ブルーブック』に名前が変わったのは、異なる目的を持った異なる管理者がいたからだ。私の叔父、エドワード・ドティがプロジェクト・ブルーブックに関わっていたことは知っている。彼は調査官だった。彼は、なぜ名前を変えたのか、また、空に浮かぶものは何なのかという疑問に対する答えがすぐにわかるような公開捜査と、答えが出せない、答えのない、よりミステリアスな事件との違いや、その分類方法について話してくれました。
(2:45:10)</p>
<p>あなたが言ったように、これは一種の偽情報 キャンペーンなのです。なぜなら、政府が話した中で、正当な地球外生命体や地球外生命体との接触であると特定されたケースは一つもなかったからです。
これらのケースは機密扱いだった。極秘扱いだったのだ。そして、他の誰かに調査を依頼した。現地調査員は、既知の天体のケースのみを調査した。率直に言って、人々が見ていたもののほとんどは、飛行機、研究開発用飛行機、あるいは金星、惑星ビーナス、その他のものとして簡単に識別できた。
(2:46:15)</p>
<p>しかし、そうでないものは、政府が公の場に出てきて、「この700件、701件、701件が特定できない。そして、あらゆる兆候からして、それらは地球外生命体である。内々ではそう言っているが、機密文書ではそう言っている。
(2:46:41)</p>
<p>しかし、彼らはそれを公表するつもりはない。私たちは皆、そのことを理解していると思います。でも、私が言いたいのは、ありがとうございます。私が言いたいのは、誤報や偽情報について話すとき、これらは直接的なものだということです。つまり、自分で調べたり、フォローアップしたりできることなのです。
(2:47:12)</p>
<p>そしてブルーブックとセルポ、確かにインターネット版のセルポとマルティネス、そして何が起こっていたのか、そしてすべてのプレーヤーたち、名前のリストや鳥小屋やその他もろもろのことには触れたくない。しかし、それは非常に集中的で包括的なキャンペーンだった。現実ではなかった。そして、もしかしたら本物かもしれない要素もあったが、それは誤った情報だった。
(2:47:39)</p>
<p>インターネットで一般大衆に直接流された偽情報だった。そして、私はその渦中にい  た。リック、私はまさにそこにいた。毎日毎日、最新情報を読んでいた。マルティネスにもっと情報を提供してくれるのを待ちきれなかったよ。わかったよ。そうだな、俺にもそんな気概があればよかったんだが。
(2:48:00)</p>
<p>僕は今頃億万長者だ。SF小説でも書いてるさ。誰が書いたんだ？その通りだ。その通りだ。最高のSFだった。とてもクリエイティブな作家が何人もいた。リック・ドティもその一人だ。では、MJ-12について話しましょう。繰り返しになりますが、あなたの意見では、私はすでに述べましたが、ワシントンD.C.からの誤報、偽情報キャンペーンですか？ええ、これらの文書はDIA内の特別手段委員会で作成されたものです。情報の中には合法的なものもある。
(2:48:50)</p>
<p>つまり、名前や日付、場所を確認することはできるし、誰がどこにいたかを調べることもできる。でも、その大部分は偽情報だったと言えると思います。
(2:49:25)</p>
<p>わかった、わかった。誰がそれを手に入れたのかを理解しなければならない。

Headline edition, July 8th, 1947. The Army Air Forces has announced that a flying disc has been found and is now in the possession of the Army. Would the gaming rig change the game?

Crazy breaking news right before the show tonight.
Amtrak. That&#x27;s right.
Amtrak in the news.
All long-distance Amtrak trains are canceled starting tomorrow, Thursday, September 15th. Negotiations are ongoing between unions and railroad companies, although Amtrak isn&#x27;t part of that.
(0:12:11)</p>
<p>If they don&#x27;t come to an agreement, the first national rail strike in 30 years could kick off early on Friday. So there you go.
I know you had all those plans, right?
(0:12:25)</p>
<hr>
<p>The Orient Express. I know you had that planned.
It&#x27;s not in the United States. All right.
Ukrainian President Zelensky right before showtime tonight got in a car accident, but he emerged with no serious injuries.
The car collision was in Kiev right before showtime tonight.
According to a statement from the president&#x27;s press secretary, a car collided with the car of the president of Ukraine and escort vehicles.
(0:12:57)</p>
<p>Strange, right?
Authorities are investigating the circumstances of the incident, and there is no more information at this time.
I&#x27;ll follow up with everything tomorrow on the show.
But it seems a little bit funky because another top ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin has died today, this time of an alleged stroke, while on a business trip in the village of Rushino in Russia&#x27;s Far East region.
(0:13:34)</p>
<p>Vladimir Sungorkin, 68 years old, was the editor-in-chief of the Russian state newspaper Pravda. According to the newspaper, Sungorkin died suddenly after showing signs of suffocation during his trip earlier today.
Man, I&#x27;m not gonna comment on this.
I don&#x27;t know what the solution is.
But I mean, don&#x27;t take a trip to Eastern Russia. That&#x27;s top on the list.
Whoever you... Don&#x27;t go to East Russia. Bad things happen.
(0:14:10)</p>
<p>Germany and Japan have pledged not to conduct destructive anti-satellite tests that could create dangerous clouds of space debris in orbit.
The announcement of these pledges were made at the second session of the United Nations on reducing space threats, which is being held in Geneva to reduce those threats in space.
Germany and Japan&#x27;s announcement follows similar pledges made by the United States, Canada, and New Zealand. There you go.
(0:14:45)</p>
<p>Threat in space.
Yeah, we saw this coming.
Let&#x27;s get this show cracking.
On this day in history, 1959, another threat in space.
1959, a Soviet rocket carrying the flag of the Soviet Union crashes into the moon, becoming the first man-made object sent from Earth to reach the lunar surface.
That&#x27;s how they got there.
Couldn&#x27;t land it.
It just crashed it with the Soviet flag.
(0:15:20)</p>
<ol start="1959">
<li>That&#x27;s a threat in space.
Fader fact.
All right, here you go.
And the clock starts now.
In the time it took for you to listen to me say that, around 100,000 cells in your body died and were replaced by new ones.
Yeah, that&#x27;s pretty cool.
And that is your fader fact.
You know, I just finished The White Lotus. Have you guys seen that yet?
(0:16:00)</li>
</ol>
<p>Have you guys watched The White Lotus?
It&#x27;s on HBO. HBO Max. HBO. The White Lotus. Go and check it out.
All right, it&#x27;s not what you think.
The White Lotus is a resort in Hawaii. So it&#x27;s a series, six episodes.
Jennifer Coolidge. They need the small trains so they can make the big trains.
I love Jennifer Coolidge. She&#x27;s amazing.
And she&#x27;s amazing in this.
(0:16:30)</p>
<p>I think she just won an Emmy for her performance in that.
But The White Lotus, when it came out, got past me.
(0:16:38)</p>
<hr>
<p>And I just finished my binge.
If you haven&#x27;t watched The White Lotus, it just got picked up for season two.
It was only supposed to be six episodes, just one off an anthology.
So they&#x27;re doing it again.
And yeah, but it&#x27;s not going to be in Hawaii. I think it&#x27;s going to be in Spain. Some of the stars, I don&#x27;t know how they&#x27;re going to do it.
(0:17:01)</p>
<p>All right, I just spoke too much.
Just check out The White Lotus. And I bring that up because... Cobra Kai. Cobra Kai. The new season is out.
Oh, man.
It&#x27;s weird how I... I love science fiction so much.
And the movies.
And Thor, Love and Thunder, is out.
And I still haven&#x27;t watched that.
It&#x27;s sitting there.
And I&#x27;m going to get to it.
(0:17:33)</p>
<p>But I love my science fiction.
I do.
But getting away from science fiction, like Parks and Recreation, right?
Brooklyn Nine-Nine, amazing.
And Cobra Kai, you know, things like that.
I like to get off of science fiction and just get into this doofus stuff.
What was that other one?
Kimmy Schmidt Saves the World or whatever that thing was called.
Man, that was a great series.
(0:18:00)</p>
<p>I enjoyed it.
All right, let me hit this Rivermoon Coffee. Tonight, Richard Doty is back with us.
We&#x27;re going to be talking about the possible disinfo, misinfo, and ufology.
I&#x27;m going to talk more about that in just a minute.
And tomorrow&#x27;s another fader night with open lines all night long.
Yeah, there you go.
Thank you for that, Olivia. Jennifer Coolidge, she&#x27;s amazing.
And Napoleon Dynamite. You remember Napoleon Dynamite&#x27;s uncle, the quarterback from the football team, right?
(0:18:33)</p>
<p>You remember him?
I used to throw that... throw for a mile.
You remember that, right?
Okay, anyway, he&#x27;s in the White Lotus. He&#x27;s Jennifer Coolidge&#x27;s boyfriend.
All right, spoiler alert.
Yeah, that&#x27;s pretty cool.
Okay, anyway, tomorrow night is fader night with open lines all night long.
Let me hit this Rivermoon Coffee. I like my coffee, Doc. Like Rick Doty. Rick Doty likes his coffee, Doc. Rivermoon Coffee. Rivermoonwellness.com. The links are below.
(0:19:10)</p>
<p>Promo code F2BBLEND. All right, disinformation.
Misinformation. They have been part of ufology in our community for decades.
This, my friends, my family, this is a fact.
That&#x27;s right.
If you want direct, serious proof, I&#x27;ll start with this.
Project Blue Book. That&#x27;s right.
Think about this for a second.
Because, you know, and that went on for, let&#x27;s go, I&#x27;m going to round some numbers off.
(0:20:05)</p>
<p>1950 to 1960, 1960, 1970. Okay, so let&#x27;s go round about 20 years of misinfo, disinfo.
Project Blue Book was written, it was designed to, and published for, spreading of disinformation directly to the public about UFOs. That&#x27;s right.
Our very own government and the U.S. Air Force, all with taxpayer dollars.
Now, think about that.
And this went on in an official capacity.
And think about the amount of work that was put into Project Blue Book. Right?
(0:20:57)</p>
<p>You got J. Allen Hynek, you got his team going out investigating cases, and then publishing the results of that in a deliberate attempt to spread disinformation.
(0:21:09)</p>
<hr>
<p>Right?
Think about that.
And any of the serious cases in there, and there were 701 that were never resolved, no serious research there, no comment there, right?
And that is misinformation.
Think about that.
All right?
This went on for 20 years.
And when you want to say, well, why would they... there&#x27;s a lot of reasons for it.
And I think that on top of the food chain, that if there is anything to talk about, if there&#x27;s any knowledge about the UFO subject, that is something that the Air Force, the military, the Pentagon, the White House decided that we didn&#x27;t need to know.
(0:22:04)</p>
<p>And that&#x27;s it.
That was a subject that was going to be kept from the American public and the world.
And at the front of all of that was Project Blue Book. But that&#x27;s not the only... If you want a direct example, right?
And by spreading that throughout ufology to all of the researchers that were researching the subject in the 50s and 60s that knew about Project Blue Book, think about the influence that it had on everybody else out there.
(0:22:49)</p>
<p>So there&#x27;s that.
But then we can move forward.
I&#x27;ll give you another example, in my opinion.
We have Project Serpo. And Project Serpo, again, I think that there is enough data and information out there to suggest to everyone that it was, once again, disinformation created by our government through any means to spread disinformation into the UFO community.
And it was very effective.
It was very effective.
(0:23:27)</p>
<p>And it was done with modern means, electronically, the internet.
So you have that.
And Project Serpo, I can&#x27;t express enough that it was a situation in my life.
And I&#x27;m sure that you can go, the internet, UFO Wayback Machine, go and find the original website and certainly the latest iteration of the website with all of the updates and look at how much information was there.
(0:24:07)</p>
<p>It was crazy.
And I was coming home every day looking for another update from Martinez. Is there going to be something there?
And these updates were, you know, detailed and deep.
And we had the aviary and, oh, man, it was nuts.
But it wasn&#x27;t real, right?
And I think that, and especially with the people that were involved with it, all fingers point back to Washington and different three-letter agencies.
(0:24:42)</p>
<p>So there&#x27;s an example right there.
Now, why would they do it, right?
Now, I think that there were a lot of reasons for that to happen like it did.
And I think that with disinformation and misinformation and the way that it&#x27;s handled and distributed throughout the UFO community, the government wants to know who&#x27;s talking to who.
Who are your sources?
Who are you giving information to?
(0:25:08)</p>
<p>Is there a leak inside of the Pentagon or inside of the CIA, right?
Is there, right?
And who is communicating?
So you put these little nuggets out there and then you find out through cross-channels and communication who was talking to who.
(0:25:26)</p>
<hr>
<p>And I think Serpo did exactly that.
Exactly that.
But probably not as much as the MJ-12 document.
All right?
Now, here&#x27;s the deal.
MJ-12 documents this thick.
Well, everybody involved, except for Stanton Friedman, had connections back to the Air Force and the Air Force OSI and other government agencies and, of course, the Pentagon, right?
The OSI, the Office of Special Investigations. And Rick can certainly comment further on that during the broadcast tonight.
(0:26:13)</p>
<p>But here&#x27;s the deal.
When we go back and you look at Project Blue Book and you look at Serpo and others too as well, I don&#x27;t have the time tonight to go through every single case of disinformation and misinformation that&#x27;s been out there.
But just like Blue Book and Serpo with Stanton Friedman, you have somebody that&#x27;s legitimately involved in all of these, and that adds to the credibility of what you&#x27;re dealing with.
(0:26:47)</p>
<p>And having Stanton there with Jamie Shandoray, right, and Bill Moore, it added to the credibility of what MJ-12 was all about.
And Stanton went off and did his own investigation into it, and it was something that just sat there and not only spread through the UFO community, but if you think that we are in the days of disclosure today, when the MJ-12 documents came out and how they came out, we all thought that we were in disclosure, that this was it.
(0:27:28)</p>
<p>This was the document truth.
This wasn&#x27;t the three grainy leaked Navy videos of UAPs. We&#x27;re talking about stacks of documents that had to go and get reviewed that all appeared to be official.
Now, you need to think about that.
That was a pretty effective campaign, and it really kept everybody going in and chasing their tails in every direction.
But today, because that&#x27;s 20 years ago, those were the old days.
(0:28:04)</p>
<p>Today, we have social media.
Today, we have the internet.
Of course, we have websites, and it&#x27;s much easier and faster to spread the seeds that you want or need to sow, those seeds of disinformation, of misinformation, to create distrust, right, to start a feud or two, character attacks.
Yeah, it&#x27;s so much easier than delivering a package to an address with a roll of film in it, you know, and you got to wait and see what&#x27;s going to happen.
(0:28:36)</p>
<p>Is the package going to get open?
Is the film going to be there?
Is it going to be developed?
Is somebody going to do something with it?
You have to sit and wait.
Not today.
Oh, no.
With the net, we know action is just a click away, and you can monitor everything in real time. You can see who was talking to who, right?
(0:29:00)</p>
<p>And you know what I&#x27;m talking about because you do it every day, don&#x27;t you?
Of course, you do.
When we talk about Mockingbird and the ability for agencies in Washington, D.C. to get journalists out there, newscasters, talking heads on the payroll to handle misinformation and disinformation, to handle what the public hears and sees and reads, right?
(0:29:35)</p>
<hr>
<p>Today, with the internet, you don&#x27;t have to pay.
You don&#x27;t have to go and recruit these journalists and these newscasters.
It&#x27;s all on the internet.
Think about that.
So, is that going down in ufology today?
Yes, I think it&#x27;s a fact.
It has to.
It&#x27;s too easy.
And it&#x27;s just not ufology, it&#x27;s everything.
That&#x27;s why I wanted Rick Doty on the show tonight.
(0:30:07)</p>
<p>I&#x27;m your host, Jimmy Church. This is Fade to Black on the Game Changer and Un-X Networks. Tomorrow night is Fader Night with open lines all night long.
Stay tuned for that.
And when I come back after this short break, Rick Doty is here.
I need to talk to Rick about what&#x27;s going down today.
Is there misinformation, disinformation in ufology in our community?
I hope we find out.
(0:30:36)</p>
<p>I&#x27;m your host, Jimmy Church. This is Fade to Black. We&#x27;ll be right back after this short break.
Stay with us.
This is Nicole Church, daughter of you-know-who. And you&#x27;re listening to Fade to Black on JimmyChurchRadio.com and the Game Changer Network. You&#x27;re listening to Jimmy Church and Fade to Black on the X. You&#x27;re listening to Jimmy Church, Fade to Black. Fade to Black will now pause for alien identification.
(0:31:40)</p>

<p>Fade to black is not your father&#x27;s radio show on the Game Changer Radio Network. Hi, this is Rob Reiner from Anvil. And you&#x27;re listening to JimmyChurchRadio.com What&#x27;s up?
What&#x27;s up?
All right, welcome back.
Fade to black.
I am your host, Jimmy Church. I gotta stretch.
I gotta get ready.
Rick Doty&#x27;s here tonight.
That&#x27;s right.
We&#x27;ve got a lot to talk about.
Oh, I got a little short in my headphones.
(0:35:49)</p>
<p>Hold on.
Let&#x27;s see if I&#x27;m back.
I&#x27;m back.
He was born in New York State, but grew up in a military family, then served his country in the United States Air Force. He was hired by the Air Force Office of Special Investigation after attending intelligence course taught by the Air Force Office of Special Investigations, Defense Intelligence Agency and the Central Intelligence Agency. He served at Kirkland Air Force Base as a counterintelligence officer.
(0:36:18)</p>
<p>He saw duty at the Nevada Test Site, the Air Force Test Center, Detachment 3, Groom Lake, Nevada. He also investigated the Coyote Canyon UFO sighting on Kirkland Air Force Base. And of course, the Paul Bennewitz incident.
He was also assigned to AFOSI European Headquarters. We spotting.
Oh, we spotting.
Really?
I didn&#x27;t know that.
As a counterespionage agent, after leaving the AFOSI, he was assigned to the Air Force Reserve Unit and later was employed by the state of New Mexico. He also worked for the Institute for Advanced Studies and with Hal Puthoff. And today he&#x27;s retired and employed as a consultant.
(0:37:00)</p>
<p>He&#x27;s actually a movie star and is featured in GAIA TV&#x27;s Cosmic Disclosure. And we&#x27;ve got links for Rick below.
And I would like to welcome back to Fade to Black, Rick Doty. Richard Doty. Rick Doty, how are you doing tonight, sir?
Great, Jimmy. Great to be here.
Great to be on your show.
Yeah, I love the smile, you know.
And, you know, Rick&#x27;s like, okay, man, I hope this goes well.
(0:37:27)</p>
<p>But here&#x27;s the thing.
Let&#x27;s actually just start out of the gate.
Rick, you and I know each other.
We&#x27;ve had our bumps in, you know, in the road in the past.
But we&#x27;ve hung out.
We broke bread.
I think we&#x27;ve had a cocktail or two as well.
I&#x27;ve even introduced you.
I think, wait a minute.
Were you on one of my panels once?
(0:37:50)</p>
<p>Yes, I was.
Yeah, okay.
So we&#x27;ve kind of, you know, we&#x27;ve done everything in the past.
So just with the measure of trust, I have to ask this.
You know that there are people listening to this show right now that are going, we can&#x27;t believe anything that comes out of Doty&#x27;s mouth.
(0:38:15)</p>
<hr>
<p>You know, how can we trust what he says?
And this is something that you&#x27;re confronted with, I&#x27;m sure, or you feel that pressure every single day.
I need your response to that.
Well, I had a job to do years ago with the Air Force Office of Special Investigations as a counterintelligence officer.
A lot of my work wasn&#x27;t pleasant work.
A lot of it involved disinformation, misinformation.
(0:38:46)</p>
<p>A lot of that information has leaked or been released through FOIA over the years.
And the one thing that people hold against me is the Paul Benowitz case.
Yes. Well, and you can include me, right?
We have talked about this.
Absolutely. And the story is, I was instructed to do an operation against Paul Benowitz because of what he knew and what he was doing.
(0:39:20)</p>
<p>And I had to provide him information that wasn&#x27;t totally accurate.
But if you&#x27;ve read the report, many people have, and listened to me, and some of the people even had talked to Paul before he passed away.
They found out the truth is, I never fed him anything that he didn&#x27;t want to hear.
Paul Benowitz was already a believer in UFOs. And so it wasn&#x27;t difficult for me to convince him of what we wanted him to believe.
(0:39:55)</p>
<p>And that&#x27;s what they hold against me all these years.
I used to get hundreds and hundreds of emails, probably 60% of them pretty nasty ones.
But today, in 2022, I still get a lot of emails, but most of them are really positive.
I still get some negative ones.
As long as they&#x27;re polite, negative, I&#x27;ll answer, I&#x27;ll respond to them.
But I&#x27;m not the horrible, evil person that people thought of me, and primarily because of Paul Benowitz. When people get to know me and meet me, they like me.
(0:40:40)</p>
<p>You know, they like you to sit down and talk.
I&#x27;ve had some... Rick, Rick, is that disinformation?
Is acting that role part of the agent&#x27;s job?
Oh, absolutely.
Yeah, it is.
I mean, we&#x27;re taught that.
We&#x27;re taught to do that.
But I left government service, and other than Air Force Reserves, which I didn&#x27;t have anything to do with UFOs, I left government services years ago, and I didn&#x27;t work in that particular arena since.
(0:41:21)</p>
<p>Now, jumping to here today, there are people out there that are performing disinformation against the UFO community, and I&#x27;ve known him.
I know about him.
I&#x27;ve tried to out him.
Some people listen to me, some people don&#x27;t. But we have to be really, really careful.
I mean, we... I consider myself still within the UFO community.
We have to be very careful of what people are saying now, today, about the UFO phenomena, or UAP phenomena, and how that could harm future disclosure.
(0:42:05)</p>
<p>And we&#x27;re obviously going to talk about that in the show.
Let me ask you another direct question.
You retired in 2000, right?
I retired... No, from government service, I retired in 1988. Oh, okay.
(0:42:28)</p>
<hr>
<p>No, I was in the reserves.
Well, you were in the reserves in 94. Yeah, I did.
I was in the Air Force Reserves up till 94. My intelligence service ended in 88. In 88. Could you comment about what your job would have been like if you had social media in 1988?
Oh, wow.
We could have manipulated... We could have been sitting at a desk on a computer manipulating everyone we wanted to manipulate.
(0:43:11)</p>
<p>We could have been feeding so much misinformation through the social media network that it would have changed people&#x27;s thinking.
Because I know that you heard my comments opening up the show.
Yes, yes.
And if we go back and think about some of the pretty monstrous, pretty huge disinfo campaigns, obviously Project Blue Book. Imagine if Project Blue Book was dealt with on social media.
(0:43:42)</p>
<p>Holy crap, right?
It would have been a totally different game.
The MJ-12 documents.
If social media would have been around... The internet was in its infancy back then, for sure.
But it would have been a different game with social media.
Project Serpo, which was on the internet, but there was no social media then.
That was a website.
So, again, its effectiveness.
But when you put an envelope in the mail, right, with a roll of film in it, that&#x27;s like printing flyers to your band&#x27;s concert, right?
(0:44:20)</p>
<p>You&#x27;re hoping for the best, right?
And it&#x27;s a slow process.
But with social media today, it&#x27;s instant.
And certainly, anybody in Washington, D.C., in the game understands this.
Oh, absolutely.
You know, disinformation or misinformation or disinformation, whatever you want to call it, it&#x27;s false information that tends to deceive something, deceive an operation or deceive people.
And it still goes on today.
Normally, what we... The main purpose of disinformation back in the days when I was taught, when I actually went to a classroom and taught how to spread disinformation, was to deceive the Soviet Union, deceive our enemies.
(0:45:13)</p>
<p>But you can use it in any type of operation to deceive someone.
And just think about it.
It happens all the time in industry.
One particular company is trying to deceive, trying to get up our hand on another company.
So they spread false information about another person&#x27;s product.
That&#x27;s disinformation.
It happens all the time.
It happens in society.
It happens in the social structure of our society, where one neighbor doesn&#x27;t like another neighbor, so he spreads false information about that neighbor.
(0:45:51)</p>
<p>I mean, it&#x27;s just like that.
And it&#x27;s always going to happen.
It&#x27;s just how well you do it.
And believe me, during my time in the late 70s up to the 80s, we were good at it.
We were very, very, very good at disinformation.
We call it counterintelligence operations to protect special access programs.
And we were very, very good at it.
And let me give you an example of what we did.
(0:46:26)</p>
<p>When I worked out at Area 51, Nellis Test and Training Range, most of that area was in Nye County. Back in those days, prostitution was legal in Nye County. So we were afraid that the people that were working on classified projects, and believe me, there were many highly classified programs and projects going on at Tonopah Air Base or Area 51 or even in Nevada Test Site. So what we did was we went out and we recruited every single prostitute in Nye County. Basically, every prostitute in that county, and even in Esmeralda County, which kind of borders it, were under our control.
(0:47:21)</p>
<p>We paid them.
(0:47:21)</p>
<hr>
<p>We paid them more than they were getting doing tricks because we were afraid that military air force, primarily air force people, would come and be serviced by them.
And believe me, that happened all the time.
We didn&#x27;t want the information that they had leaking through them, through the prostitutes, out to the public.
So we owned them all.
And we made some big, major operations stopping the leak of information, classified information out of special projects, from being leaked into the public by disinformation.
(0:48:04)</p>
<p>So that&#x27;s just one example.
Can I ask you a question?
I know you&#x27;re married.
Were you married then?
No, I was not married then.
Oh, so then you could go and hang out with ladies of the night and exchange cash.
And that sounds like a pretty good, a pretty fun gig.
And one that you could get away with because you weren&#x27;t married.
I can just see you at one of these brothels doing this.
(0:48:38)</p>
<p>When you&#x27;re talking, were you trying to get information back out of these women of ill repute, these ladies of the night, to see if somebody was talking to them?
Well, yes.
What we did was we approached them and we told them right up front, uh, you&#x27;re going to have tricks that are Air Force or military people.
And they might tell you some information that could be classified.
(0:49:04)</p>
<p>So we want to know about that.
And we&#x27;re going to pay you money.
So sure enough, they&#x27;ll call, they&#x27;d call us.
Not everyone.
I mean, there were a lot of Air Force people that went there and there and did their thing and paid their 30 or $40 for their pleasure and never said anything or never disclosed anything.
But there were a lot of them that went in there and tried to impress the prostitutes by saying, you know, I&#x27;m working on this really classified project out there.
(0:49:34)</p>
<p>And, and, you know, there&#x27;s aliens out there and these things like that.
Wow. So what they would do is they would immediately contact us and, and say, listen, we got it.
You know, I had a trick that told me some information.
So then we had to go out there and it wasn&#x27;t just me.
There were a lot of other agents involved in this.
(0:49:55)</p>
<p>And they were going out there and they would talk to, to the, to the prostitute and say, well, you know, he&#x27;s just trying to impress you.
None of that stuff is real.
You know, and, and we would have to give, provide them with this information.
And so that&#x27;s how it worked.
And we actually, one Air Force pilot that was flying back in those days in the early eighties, uh, the F-117 stealth aircraft was, uh, uh, was being tested out there.
(0:50:27)</p>
<p>And it&#x27;s highly classified back then.
This pilot went in and told her, his prostitute that he was flying this really super secret plane called the F-119, not the F-117. And he told, he told them that he told his prostitute that all the technology was from the aliens. They gave it to us.
(0:50:49)</p>
<hr>
<p>So, uh, they, you know, we had to really, really press this particular prostitute.
And, uh, we ended up, uh, finding the, of course, finding the Air Force captain, kicking him out of the program and kicking him out of the Air Force. So, yeah, I can, I can hear it now.
Dougherty sure is spending a lot of time out at Mary&#x27;s fun palace.
But okay.
(0:51:34)</p>
<p>So is there a certain amount of, you know, going back to social media today and the way that you did things in the past, is there some element of truth in with the misinformation and disinformation to, to keep it feeling real?
Yes. You have to provide some real information in order for your target to believe it.
And, and it may be just a little bit, or it may be a lot in order for them to buy into it.
(0:52:06)</p>
<p>And, um, and then, and then you have, you have people that are very smart that you&#x27;re dealing with such as Linda Howell. I mean, okay. I was going to bring that up. Okay. So, uh, many may not know what we&#x27;re about to talk about. So I&#x27;m just going to give a brief summary. Um, and, uh, I&#x27;ve got to disclose.
I&#x27;ve spoken to Linda at length about this privately.
(0:52:33)</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve spoken to Rick about this at length privately. I&#x27;ve gotten both sides of the story. I&#x27;m going to say that 90% of it completely interlocks. Okay. All right. And so, uh, basically, uh, Linda was invited out to Kirkland and was promised, uh, she was in the middle of this HBO documentary that, uh, was in the works and it was in pre-production. Um, there was some, uh, the white house was, uh, she was trying to get I think that HBO wanted the white house involved and the president involved.
(0:53:09)</p>
<p>And so with all of this, she&#x27;s invited out to Kirkland. She is going to be presented some documents and she, uh, goes into your office. Um, you had a mirror, you were videotaping. I think she even saw a camera above her. I think she said that there was a camera in the room. Um, and you told her that she could read the documents, but she couldn&#x27;t take them with her.
(0:53:38)</p>
<p>Right now. Um, so that&#x27;s, that&#x27;s the summary of it. Now let&#x27;s go back to, uh, the contents of those documents. Was some of it facts, uh, with disinformation and as a matter of fact, disinformation, misinformation, two different definitions. Um, we&#x27;ll circle back to that for some clarification, but, uh, what was the purpose of showing Linda these docs? Uh, was it to find her sources? Uh, was it, was there something else involved there that had nothing to do with UFOs?
(0:54:13)</p>
<p>We needed to find her sources. We knew, uh, I got involved in this late. I mean, there were other agencies involved in this operation. Um, we knew that she was coming to, uh, and I&#x27;m not going to go into great details of how we knew all this stuff, but we knew what she was doing.
(0:54:40)</p>
<p>Okay. We knew where she was going. We knew who she was talking to for the most part. And we knew she was coming to Albuquerque. And so she was invited by me, uh, through, uh, Jerry Miller, um, who worked with me to the base. And I was going to talk to her and show her something, uh, that would help her in her, with her UB, uh, HBO special.
(0:55:05)</p>
<p>So, so she came out to the base and like you said, she was in a room, uh, to make way mirror, there were agents on the other side filming her. Plus it was a camera inside. We had a microphone in there too. She was fully aware that we were filming. I know at one point years ago, she said she didn&#x27;t, but she&#x27;s smart.
(0:55:30)</p>
<p>She told me, she looked up and saw a camera like above the door and she was sitting in the middle of the room. Your desk was on one end, right? Okay. Yeah. That&#x27;s the way that she presented that with me. And she said that the chair was awkwardly placed. Right?
(0:55:43)</p>
<hr>
<p>We had to get her right in front of the right. Anyways, uh, now the day before these documents came in through a pouch, uh, armed forces courier pouch. So I knew they were top secret from headquarters now. Uh, and I was told the pro the, the, the operation was to show her these documents.
She couldn&#x27;t take any notes and she couldn&#x27;t keep anything.
(0:56:17)</p>
<p>She couldn&#x27;t take any photographs of anything. So I had a chance prior to showing them to her to read them. Now I&#x27;m the middle guy.
Now I&#x27;m not, you got to understand that I didn&#x27;t know what headquarters knew. I was, this is what I was told to do. And I did what I was told to do. I gave them to her. She read them.
(0:56:41)</p>
<p>She started asking me questions about them. Some of the questions I could answer, some of them I couldn&#x27;t. Now, what we were hoping that after reading these documents, which I know that some of the information in there was accurate, but a lot of the information in there wasn&#x27;t accurate. What we were hoping was she&#x27;d come around to our side because she had two sources within the government that was providing her information that was of classified, it was classified information.
(0:57:17)</p>
<p>So we wanted to know who those people were. And that was the basis of our operation against Linda Howell. So after I showed her those, I said to her, listen, I&#x27;d like to get to know you, like know what you&#x27;re doing as far as programming and so forth. And she said, sure, you know, you can never have too many friends.
(0:57:43)</p>
<p>So I kept a friendship with her trying to delve into this. I&#x27;ve met her in Washington, D.C. I&#x27;ve met her in New York City, trying to find these people. Well, first of all, Linda Howell, very brilliant person.
And she knew what I was trying to do and she wasn&#x27;t going to run with it.
In fact, we were having we were in Georgetown at a cafe having lunch and I pitched her.
(0:58:19)</p>
<p>I did the pitching by saying, listen, what I want you to do is work for us. We&#x27;ll pay you. You just tell me what you know. And she just sat there and listened to me for some time and she said, not no, but hell no, in a polite way. She was a tough cookie to crack. Anyways, I maintained contact with her for some time and then another agent became involved with that operation.
(0:58:59)</p>
<p>But that&#x27;s that&#x27;s how it went. And we actually accomplished one of the was to end the HBO special because they were going to air something that we didn&#x27;t want, that the government didn&#x27;t want, U.S. intelligence didn&#x27;t want. And we were able to end that. And so part of our mission was successful.
Let&#x27;s take our break right here.
(0:59:26)</p>
<p>And when we come back, there&#x27;s a reason why Rick shared that with us. And in today&#x27;s world, in social media, by leaking or presenting information to individuals, will they turn around and post it on social media? And that is a very, very effective tool to see who&#x27;s talking and who is not and how you can turn around and get the conversation going when you need it. We&#x27;re going to talk more about that when we come back after this short break.
(0:59:59)</p>
<p>Our guest tonight, Rick Doty. We&#x27;re talking about misinfo, disinfo, and ufology and our UFO community.

<p>This is Micah Hanks of The Graylian Report, and you&#x27;re listening to Jimmy Church on Fade to Black. Welcome back. Fade to Black. I&#x27;m your host, Jimmy Church. Tonight, Rick Doty is with us. We&#x27;re talking about misinformation and disinformation in the UFO community and ufology in general.
(1:05:32)</p>
<hr>
<p>Listening to the break there with Micah Hanks, I just spent the weekend with Micah. I haven&#x27;t had that much fun. I haven&#x27;t laughed that hard in a very long time. Micah Hanks is amazing, and more on what we were doing coming up here very soon, and we&#x27;ll have full disclosure on that. Hey, Rick, let&#x27;s get into some definitions real quick as we get to the meat of the matter, what&#x27;s going on today. What&#x27;s the difference between misinformation and disinformation?
(1:06:04)</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s go in alphabetical order. What is disinformation? Disinformation is false information provided to deceive someone, something, some entities, some government.
Misinformation is the actual information that is given. That&#x27;s going to be misinformation rather than the actual bread and butter. We&#x27;re going to change it around. Misinformation is normally given to a person.
(1:06:44)</p>
<p>Disinformation is part of an operation. Oh, I got you. Oh, that&#x27;s a big difference. Okay. Misinformation would be like the document or what is verbally said. Yes, exactly.
And disinformation is the agenda. All right. Okay. Got you. Got you.
I got to be very careful on how I&#x27;m wording this. I have been told lots of things over the years, of course.
(1:07:14)</p>
<p>Okay. All right. I have lots of people approach me, and I have relationships out there, but I don&#x27;t share it. I keep it all inside. I don&#x27;t talk to people about it. I don&#x27;t get on the phone and go, guess what? I don&#x27;t do that. And I don&#x27;t speak about it on the air.
And I think that there is a couple of things that have happened because of that.
(1:07:36)</p>
<p>One, if anybody is attempting to use a disinformation campaign or give misinformation to me, it doesn&#x27;t work because I don&#x27;t turn around and share it. But there&#x27;s a second thing that has resulted from this. I observe. Right? So I know what I&#x27;m told. So I listen to what other people are saying.
(1:08:10)</p>
<p>And I read what other people are posting. And I see if it is also out there because I know what I was told, allegedly, you know, in confidence. Right? And that it&#x27;s getting out there in other areas. And sometimes it&#x27;s even changed a little bit. And so I look back with squinty eyes and I go, okay, all right, there&#x27;s something going on here.
(1:08:33)</p>
<p>But I don&#x27;t talk about it. And I don&#x27;t want to be a part of the story. But I will certainly observe. And that&#x27;s the case.
And I watch this and it is going on right now, today. Oh, yes. You know, the social media today is something I wish we would have had years ago. But social media is a public forum.
That means anyone can access it.
(1:09:14)</p>
<p>And of course, that means government entities, such as Air Force Intelligence, DIA, CIA, FBI, DEA. So the social media opens up a wide range of access into the public itself. And the government is taking advantage of these social medias, Twitter, so forth and so on. So it&#x27;s easy to post something on in some chat room, or on Facebook, or on Instagram or Twitter, Twitter thread with a cutout, meaning the United States Air Force isn&#x27;t going to post it.
(1:10:12)</p>
<p>But somebody within Air Force Intelligence is going to contact somebody else who will contact the third person that will post it.
(1:10:18)</p>
<hr>
<p>So it can&#x27;t come back to US intelligence. And then they&#x27;re going to watch what happens with that information. I&#x27;ve seen it on Twitter in the last few weeks. UFO, UAP information, UAP, people wanting us to believe something about the UAP program. They post something about Lou Elizondo, or Chris Mellons, or me, or somebody else.
(1:10:48)</p>
<p>And then they want it, and they see how far it runs. So it&#x27;s happening. It&#x27;s happening. It&#x27;s happened for ever since social media has been in existence. Now, will that change people&#x27;s minds? Yes, it will change people&#x27;s minds.
It will bring people in or push people out. And that&#x27;s what somebody wants. They want, and maybe the government, and I don&#x27;t know this for a fact, I know people are going to say, well, maybe I&#x27;m still in the government.
(1:11:25)</p>
<p>I&#x27;m not. I have a group of people that I&#x27;m working with, and where I&#x27;m at right now, actually, Jimmy, I&#x27;m going to disclose that I moved from one place that I was talking to you about yesterday to another location closer to you. So I&#x27;m actually in the same time zone as you, with some people having meetings about some other things that we&#x27;re trying to do, including a U.S. Senator. So we&#x27;re on one side of this disclosure.
(1:11:52)</p>
<p>Chris and Lou is on another team trying to get this disclosure. I&#x27;m not involved with them, and they&#x27;re not involved with us. So I can tell you right now that I&#x27;m not aligned with Lou Elizondo or Chris Mullins. They have their own agenda. I was invited into their group, as some of the other people have that I&#x27;m working with, but we&#x27;ve politely said, no, we&#x27;re going to do it in a different way and want disclosure out there. We want disclosure.
(1:12:24)</p>
<p>But there are entities within the government that do not want disclosure. And one of them is the United States Space Force. They do not want... the Colonel, if people have looked at YouTube in the last several months, during one of his interviews, one of the Colonels at Colorado Springs and Air Force Base specifically says, we&#x27;re not cooperating with any disclosure project.
They don&#x27;t want it out there. Because right now the Space Command has the UFO files.
(1:12:58)</p>
<p>I know that for a fact. And so they want to keep things secretive.
Now there&#x27;s other entities within the government that want the subject out. I think the fact that they had the congressional hearings some time ago this summer, that was a flop, total flop, because the two people that were there to answer questions, although they were very honorable people, they had no idea what they were talking about.
(1:13:32)</p>
<p>They had no idea about anything in the past, no history whatsoever. They didn&#x27;t even know what Roswell was. That&#x27;s right. Randall Shimm. It&#x27;s just ridiculous that they have them out there and they couldn&#x27;t answer any of the questions.
What about the ability to have a fake account, you know, on Twitter or on Facebook or on Instagram or TikTok, whatever.
(1:14:12)</p>
<p>It&#x27;s got to be very inexpensive because I picture a platoon, in the Air Force, NSA, whatever, sitting in a room running social media where one enlisted person has 100 accounts that they&#x27;re running and they&#x27;re out there established in social media and running an agenda, a disinformation campaign. Oh, that&#x27;s true. Yeah, exactly. In fact, we interviewed two weeks ago, we interviewed a female who had just got out of the Air Force. She served six or seven years in.
(1:14:55)</p>
<p>She got out of the Air Force and we interviewed her on camera for a show that&#x27;s going to appear sometime later. She was in that group. She was sitting in a bunker, a below ground bunker, and she was in the Air Force and her job was to monitor social media and spread information that she was told to spread.
(1:15:23)</p>
<p>That&#x27;s all her job was in her six years in the Air Force. That&#x27;s what she did. And there were, as you said, another platoon, well, in the Air Force, they call them flights. There was a whole flight of people in this room in front of very sophisticated computers monitoring and spreading information. I mean, she had fully admitted it.
(1:15:52)</p>
<p>She told us some things that I don&#x27;t want to talk about now, but how they did things and how they were able to get stuff out and how the accounts were set up, which is quite extraordinary. They were using real names of real people with their sanctioned. They were paid. These people are, you know, John Doe from Flint, Michigan as a real person, but they&#x27;re using his name and his identity, and he&#x27;s fully aware of it, to set these accounts up.
(1:16:26)</p>
<p>It has to be done that way. It has to be effective because if anybody&#x27;s going to go backwards and look into one of these accounts, you&#x27;d see that it&#x27;s an actual real person.
(1:16:39)</p>
<hr>
<p>And if you want to do a deeper dive, you could probably even get their address and employment information. Then you find out that they&#x27;re real people. It&#x27;s just not a made up name like Ben Gaspett, fill my pockets, right, or whatever, that these are actual names. And I want to circle back for a second.
(1:17:10)</p>
<p>You mentioned the Space Force. There&#x27;s something weird going on in social media with Lou Elizondo and the Space Force, that he is a member of the Space Force. And I don&#x27;t believe that he is. And it&#x27;s not that I&#x27;m questioning this. I think that this is the way that it is handled out there on social media, not directly from Lou himself.
(1:17:30)</p>
<p>He could be a paid consultant or something. But to be a member of Space Force, you have to be enlisted, right?
You have to be in uniform. I&#x27;ve been to the Space Force base here in California. I saw SpaceX launch myself. I interacted with Space Force personnel, and they are all in uniform, right? And so is that misinformation and disinformation on social media to present Lou as an enlisted member of the Space Force when indeed he is not? That could be very well.
(1:18:12)</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve heard this, and I&#x27;ve had a number of emails sent to me asking me that same question. I don&#x27;t know that he&#x27;s associated at all with Space Force. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s just disinformation that&#x27;s being spread by somebody to discredit Lou. But you&#x27;re right. They&#x27;d have to be members. They would have to be either enlisted or an officer, or they would have to be some civilian GS-level employee.
(1:18:42)</p>
<p>And I don&#x27;t think he is. But again, I don&#x27;t know for a fact. I just heard the same rumor you have.
I like this comment here from the chat room. Sounds like UFO Twitter was created by the Air Force to misinform us. And I don&#x27;t know much about UFO Twitter. And I haven&#x27;t participated.
(1:19:08)</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know anything about it. And it&#x27;s a small part of the UFO community. The UFO community is huge. And I would say that the majority of the UFO community isn&#x27;t on Twitter at all, right, let alone UFO Twitter. But what goes on there certainly could be controlled through fake accounts and those that want to influence opinion.
Oh, absolutely.
(1:19:41)</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely. And you can easily influence... it wouldn&#x27;t take much work to misinform and disinform people on social media. I mean, just one little bit of information can travel to millions of people. And then that little bit, those millions will send it to more.
And next thing you know, if you plan it right, you&#x27;re going to get 20 or 30 million people thinking or reading the same thing and starting to change their opinion on something.
(1:20:13)</p>
<p>Yeah, because I was getting... this is what I found really, really strange, is I started to get a flood of email from people saying, you need to be careful, Church, because Lou is a member of the Space Force. And he knows what&#x27;s going on. And I thought, where did this rumor get started? Member? Member of the Space Force? I don&#x27;t think a member of the Space Force is hanging out on social media.
(1:20:47)</p>
<p>I just don&#x27;t think Washington would like for something like that to be going on. But people, once you post it out there enough times, it becomes truth. That&#x27;s right. That&#x27;s exactly how it works. Exactly how it works. And we used to post things in newspapers. And of course, we didn&#x27;t have the internet back in those days. But we would post things in newspapers or we&#x27;d co-op news people.
(1:21:19)</p>
<p>When I was in Kirtland, we had sources within every entity of the news business, newspapers, the radio stations, and the television stations. And if we wanted something aired, we got it aired. If we didn&#x27;t want something aired, they wouldn&#x27;t air it, or they would distort it for us. And that&#x27;s how it is. The only way we could manipulate the local surroundings would be owning the television or newspaper. And also, I was watching the comments here in the chat room.
(1:22:03)</p>
<p>Yes, Rick is at a secret location. He&#x27;s at a hotel somewhere in the middle of the desert doing the show tonight. And there you go. Well, I&#x27;m going to talk about that if I get a chance about why I&#x27;m here. Okay. No. Why? Why are you there? Okay. A few months ago, well, several months ago, we, our group, got a hold of an inter-control roster for all of Area 51. The roster was dated from January 1st, 1979 to December 31st, 1990. It&#x27;s on one of these old computer dot matrix, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve seen them before, 24-inch wide computer printouts.
(1:23:01)</p>
<p>Right. The form feed, form feed printer. Yeah, form feed printer. There&#x27;s about 3,000 pages.
(1:23:07)</p>
<hr>
<p>Everyone that had access to Det 3 Air Force Test and Test Flight Center, which was at Area 51, Air Force Research and Development Operations Center, which was right in that same area, Southern Nellis Test Range, which is just north of Creech Air Force Base, in that area there, Site Sydney, which is a communications site, and Site Homey, which is the actually airfield at Area 51. So, what we&#x27;re doing now is we&#x27;re going through that and we&#x27;re going to out people who claim to have been there during that time period.
(1:23:54)</p>
<p>Now, it&#x27;s only between January 1st, 1979 to December 31st, 1990. Everyone that had access to those locations, their last name, first name, middle initial. Okay, Bob Lazar, is he on that? Yes, he is.
Bob Lazar is on that list, but only for a very short period of time. And we&#x27;re going to go through this and we&#x27;re going to out some people and we&#x27;re going to go back and show that some people who claim that they were there and nobody wants to believe them, they were there.
(1:24:35)</p>
<p>And this has a lot of other information on it, but it&#x27;s only during that time period. Now, we can&#x27;t say who was there after that or even before that, but there&#x27;s a lot of people out there who claim to have been there during that time period that they weren&#x27;t there. We can prove that they weren&#x27;t there.
(1:24:57)</p>
<p>They didn&#x27;t have any access. Now, all we&#x27;re going to say is your name&#x27;s not on it. Is your name on it? Oh, my name&#x27;s on it. Yes. The first thing I looked at was my name and it&#x27;s there. My name is there. And the people that I&#x27;ve worked with that are former retired intelligence officers that were there, their names are there too.
So everyone who claims within the intelligence community that I&#x27;ve spoken with or that have talked to me about it or went public, who spoke with Annie Jacobson and Alex Ward, they&#x27;re on it. Every one of those people that Annie spoke with, they&#x27;re on it.
(1:25:39)</p>
<p>And some of them for the entire period of time. And then there&#x27;s some people out there who are making these wild accusations about being out there and seeing things and doing things.
Their name&#x27;s not on there. And all we&#x27;re going to do is say, listen, your name&#x27;s not on here.
Why is it on there? Let them talk about that.
(1:26:03)</p>
<p>And that&#x27;s what our project is right now. I mean, that&#x27;s one of our projects. And that&#x27;s part of this documentary that we&#x27;re going to do.
There&#x27;s a lot of people involved, good producers and directors involved.
It&#x27;s behind the time because of COVID. We had to stop filming. We were filming all around Area 51, setting up trail cameras, filming everything that was flying out of Area 51 or the Nellis Test and Training Range. It&#x27;s going to be a great, great documentary.
(1:26:33)</p>
<p>I mean, a fantastic documentary. Once we get it finished and we had to go back and cut some things out because the Air Force wanted to file an injunction against us because of what we saw and what we did. So we had to do some cutting out. And along with that, we&#x27;re going to out these people who claimed they were there.
(1:27:03)</p>
<p>But Bob Lazar was there. I mean, his name&#x27;s on there. Very interesting. Can I circle back real quick before we get to the break? You mentioned that there was something that was supposed to be in Linda&#x27;s HBO documentary that the Air Force didn&#x27;t want in there. What was that?
(1:27:14)</p>
<hr>
<p>It was the it was she was talking about an incident that happened prior to the 1974 landing at Holloman Air Force Base. Kevin Egger supposedly was going to gave her saw the film. Linda had access to something that the government didn&#x27;t want anybody to see. It was still classified. HBO had it. And then HBO turned it over to some of our intelligence people.
(1:27:49)</p>
<p>What did HBO have? Did they have film or did they have?
They actually had the original film.
Really?
Yeah. And some of it has leaked out. I mean, that there&#x27;s there&#x27;s a 15 second 50, I believe it was 15 seconds.
Yeah, yeah, we&#x27;ve all seen that. But the actual real I mean, that&#x27;s the minutes. It was 33 minutes.
Yeah, that&#x27;s the Holy Grail of ufology.
(1:28:18)</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve talked to a couple of people that one that saw a copy of another one that saw the actual now talk to the producers and and and stuff that were involved in M and Eggers project. But that&#x27;s the Holy Grail, right? Where is the original film?
Yeah, that&#x27;s I mean, I&#x27;ve seen it. Well, I haven&#x27;t seen the 33 minutes.
I saw that, of course, a 15 second one you can look at.
(1:28:44)</p>
<p>And then I saw the I think it was seven seven minutes or something. I can&#x27;t remember exactly how long it was. It was less than 10 minutes. I believe it was seven seconds, seven minutes, which was extraordinary.
I mean, it showed the landing and showed the creatures coming out of the spaceship.
That doesn&#x27;t show the meeting with the military people, but because that&#x27;s on the other the rest of the 26 minutes that there&#x27;s people that talked about it.
(1:29:17)</p>
<p>I mean, I know that Hal Puthoff had a friend that saw the whole thing and thought it was extraordinary and knew it wasn&#x27;t made by the government because it was, you know, a 1964 incident. And so the government got what they wanted. I mean, the operation was successful. They got it back.
And what did Linda? I&#x27;ve never talked to Linda about this. Did she see it?
(1:29:44)</p>
<p>I&#x27;m not sure. You&#x27;d have to ask her.
Executives at HBO that saw the Holloman film that there are civilians out there outside of ufology that have seen this? Well, all I can say is I knew they had it. I don&#x27;t know if you know who saw it, but I knew and that wasn&#x27;t my operation. It was the agents that were working in New York area and Washington. So I didn&#x27;t have access to everything that they were doing there, but they got the film back.
(1:30:21)</p>

You are listening to Fade to Black with Jimmy Church on the Game Changer Network. I&#x27;m Lee Sievans, you&#x27;re listening to Jimmy Church. This is a revolution. The revolution will not be televised. The revolution is on radio. Ciao. Welcome back Fade to Black. I&#x27;m your host Jimmy Church. Tonight Rick Doty is with us.
(1:36:51)</p>
<p>We&#x27;re talking about misinfo, disinfo inside of the UFO community and the possibility of that. And Rick just, yeah, Rick just dropped a bomb on us with this list of names and Bob Lazar, a list of names from workers at Area 51. I just popped that out on Twitter. So in your secret identity on Twitter, Rick, you can go and read that.
(1:37:27)</p>
<p>And the men in black should be knocking on your door pretty soon. I hope you&#x27;ve made copies of this list and you&#x27;ve got some stashed away. Well, when we first obtained it, we had a problem finding some place to copy it. I mean, it&#x27;s not an easier, yeah. Right, right.
(1:37:45)</p>
<hr>
<p>And so we didn&#x27;t want to go to a business like Staples or Office Depot or Office Max, but we actually found a library at a college that has an old printing system that can copy it. So that&#x27;s what we did. And then we had to verify it. We had to make sure it was in fact government, that it, you know, wasn&#x27;t, was the real thing.
(1:38:16)</p>
<p>And that was easy to do because just by the nature of it and by the markings on it, it wasn&#x27;t classified. It&#x27;s not classified.
We submitted FOIA requests to get, to verify that the existence that it&#x27;s real.
And there&#x27;s a code on it, the top of it. And when the government, the DIA, was the administrative controller for this, they initially told us that they couldn&#x27;t release it.
(1:38:51)</p>
<p>And I said, well, we already have it. We already have it. You want to come and look at it?
We can&#x27;t mail it to you, but here it is. And then they came back and said, oh yeah, okay, we can verify it. It&#x27;s not classified. It&#x27;s obsolete. So they&#x27;re not going to, they&#x27;re not going to comment on it. So now we have that letter saying, okay, it&#x27;s obsolete.
(1:39:13)</p>
<p>And it&#x27;s basically verification that it&#x27;s real. And then we went and we found a lot of people, I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a lot of people on this list that are dead. And we did verify some of that, but we went back and verified a lot of people who are still alive that are retired from different agencies. Now this is a list of everyone, including military, civilian contractors, and government employees.
(1:39:52)</p>
<p>Raytheon, Hughes Aircraft, Motorola, General Dynamics, Lockheed, before it was Lockheed Martin. All those, their names are on there, people that worked.
We went and found a lot of people. In fact, where we are right now, we came to speak to some people that are retired and that are on that list. And they&#x27;re going to verify, and we&#x27;re going to get them on camera to say, yeah, yeah, I was there during that time period. And just to verify that.
(1:40:21)</p>
<p>And then there&#x27;s people from Los Alamos and Sandia. But ironically, there&#x27;s names of people that are associated with a contractor. And we know that contractor is basically a cover for the CIA. So there&#x27;s nobody on this list with their name associated with the Central Intelligence Agency. It&#x27;s all some other cover. Sure. Well, yeah, it ran that way for a long time.
I mean, the base was constructed by the CIA. It was originally a CIA back when it was called the Ranch and Dreamland. It was CIA. Staffed by Air Force, I think Air Force Security. Okay. This is pretty exciting.
(1:41:21)</p>
<p>I feel like that&#x27;s pretty major. But is it misinformation from Richard Doty presented to Jimmy Church on Fade to Black? So we&#x27;ll leave that to the community.
But that&#x27;s pretty cool, Richard. Well, there&#x27;s other entities that got a hold of... we showed it to other people, even some people in the Air Force, current active duty people, a colonel that&#x27;s kind of on our team, and some other people.
(1:41:50)</p>
<p>So it&#x27;s real. We&#x27;re going to copy it. And we&#x27;re going to give... we&#x27;re going to bring George Knapp in on this and some other people.
(1:41:57)</p>
<hr>
<p>Ironically, somebody who you would never think that had access out there, that had access, his name is on here, is Art Bell. Art Bell went to Area 51. He went to Nellis. Bell had access there from... well, it showed him having access on June 17, 1979, to September 19, 1979. He was a contract employee for BCRS, which is the... BCRS is the television station, the closed circuit television station for the base.
(1:42:49)</p>
<p>Get the hell out of here. Yeah, I know. I said the same thing. And I tell you what, I&#x27;ve known Art forever before he died. I mean, I&#x27;ve been out there to his house. I&#x27;ve been on his program.
And Art never mentioned that he was ever out there.
What?
Yep. Now, he was either somehow associated with the closed circuit TV station out there for I don&#x27;t know what reason, maybe an advisor, maybe he set up some equipment for him or something to that. Now, one thing it doesn&#x27;t show is a security clearance.
(1:43:31)</p>
<p>It doesn&#x27;t show he had a security clearance. So maybe they just brought him out there to set something up for him. I don&#x27;t know.
He&#x27;s dead. So we can&#x27;t talk to him about it. But he was out there in that short period of time.
I can&#x27;t handle this. I can&#x27;t handle this too much.
I couldn&#x27;t handle it when I saw it.
(1:43:53)</p>
<p>I thought, well, it can&#x27;t be the same Art Bell. And then I started looking and, you know, date of birth and stuff all matched his.
Okay. Oh, man, I&#x27;ve got a hundred million. Okay. We&#x27;ve got to get off on the subject because I want to get back to misinformation and disinformation. I feel like I am... I feel like a tool now.
(1:44:20)</p>
<p>You&#x27;re feeding me this stuff. You&#x27;re spreading it. Rick, you&#x27;re spreading it right now. Wow. Really? I mean, Bob Lazar, that&#x27;s hard enough to swallow.
I mean, only because he hasn&#x27;t had anything, right? Everything has been completely circumstantial. But if this is the case, and this has got a document number on it, and, you know, you&#x27;ve researched the provenance and to make sure that it was what it is, but to have Bob Lazar&#x27;s name on it, you know, the UFO community is... I&#x27;ve already posted it in Twitter, you know, and we&#x27;ll see how this goes. Okay. Let&#x27;s swing this back around though.
(1:45:04)</p>
<p>Now, back to what is going on on social media and through... If you&#x27;re going to do this, you&#x27;re going to do this in all media outlets. There is something pretty effective going on, Rick, and that is UAPs are technology here on earth, man-made. Then you have the other side that some of it, most of it is alien and is visiting us.
(1:45:42)</p>
<p>And there seems to be something going on right now in social media that is trying to push this away from the alien conversation, and that the alien conversation is a cover-up of highly classified technology that the United States is in possession of. And it&#x27;s got people arguing and fighting about this right now.
(1:46:03)</p>
<hr>
<p>Is that a disinformation campaign? Oh, I would say so, yes. It sounds that way to me, although I don&#x27;t know anything other than what I read on the social media. But if I was to run an operation to protect some kind of special access program, knowing that this information we have, the technology that we have at Area 51 or wherever, is that we obtained somewhere, yeah, I would protect it the same way.
(1:46:41)</p>
<p>Now, what is confusing is that Chris Mellons sent something out saying, let&#x27;s get away from the UFO. Let&#x27;s only talk about UAPs and only in the context of what the Navy wants to talk about. I find that disingenuous, because why? Let&#x27;s keep the subject open. Historically speaking, we didn&#x27;t have UAPs, we had UFOs, or we had known alien crafts.
(1:47:22)</p>
<p>We had identified alien craft, IACs. I mean, that&#x27;s in documents that Stan Friedman had seen, and it&#x27;s in some of the MJ-12 documents. We know some is factual and some is not. But we have to keep the subject open in a wider sense than what some people want us not to involve. And Chris Mellons mentioned that stuff earlier, and I read that, what he talked about, and I scratched my head.
(1:47:59)</p>
<p>Why is he saying that? Let&#x27;s talk about every single realm of the UFO phenomenon. Let&#x27;s keep that out there. Let&#x27;s not close any books on that. Because if you close a book and say, let&#x27;s just leave that over there, and we&#x27;re going to talk only about this subject, that&#x27;s going to block out a lot of good information that needs to stay out there in public to force disclosure.
(1:48:28)</p>
<p>And the more we can press the government on disclosure, the more that we can push knowledge that we have out here into the government, letting them know what we know, I think there&#x27;s more of a chance for disclosure.
The recent announcement that, and this came through FOIA, John Greenwald in the Black Vault, does some of the best work out there in chasing down the facts, and does it through official government documents.
(1:49:11)</p>
<p>And so he submitted a FOIA request for all UAP videos, right? Blanket, I just want all UAP videos. And they came back and said, we&#x27;ve got them, but you&#x27;re not going to see them. And they have now been labeled classified. That&#x27;s it, in the interest of national security, right? Which is always the blanket that is put over these things, national security, and everybody freaks out on that, and they end up not touching it.
(1:49:37)</p>
<p>I feel like that is almost a misdirection and misinformation too, as well. And if it&#x27;s from outer space, if it&#x27;s interstellar, if it&#x27;s not ours, then what does that have to do with national security?
And let me give you an example, because the government is going to say, well, it&#x27;s how we detect these things.
(1:50:07)</p>
<p>We don&#x27;t want the Russians to know how good our equipment is, our sensor data, we can&#x27;t let that out. This is not sensor data. This is called a cell phone.
(1:50:15)</p>
<hr>
<p>And if a pilot is shooting something from his cockpit on a cell phone, that is not secret radar-fleer technology, right, on an aircraft that is picking this stuff up, or satellites.
It&#x27;s a cell phone. Should we be entitled to see these things?
Well, first of all, the government always wants to protect sources and methods.
I was involved with this for 12 years, whereby you have some sort of a source and a method to detect or gather intelligence.
(1:51:02)</p>
<p>And our government says, we&#x27;re not going to disclose sources or methods. Now, as an example, the congressional hearing, they had a closed camera. After they were in the public view, they went behind a camera, they call it in-camera, into a classified setting. You know what they talked about?
They talked about sources and methods, how we filmed that tic-tac, how we did... they didn&#x27;t disclose anything other than that, because I had a senator tell me.
(1:51:35)</p>
<p>He said that they didn&#x27;t talk about anything other than sources and methods. And they didn&#x27;t even talk about the sources or methods. They just said, we have a source that can detect this, and we have a method to detect these things. But that&#x27;s all they talked about. Well, let me tell you something. There&#x27;s a secret space program out there, and the secret space program is deep space probes.
(1:52:01)</p>
<p>We have satellites all over space, in our solar system, that can detect things coming in. Now, they&#x27;re classified.
Now, this colonel at Space Command... well, this was before the US Space Force. This was when Space Command was still in existence back in 2014. He said, we have 174 methods of detecting things coming in from the solar system.
(1:52:36)</p>
<p>He just disclosed right there, there&#x27;s 174 deep space probes we have out there. But he didn&#x27;t say that. He just said 174. Okay, so if you dig deep into what we have, what we know, and what others have talked about, including people within our employer there, Gaia, and other entities, we&#x27;ve launched things out of... the pilots of one of the Discovery in 1983 admitted that they launched a classified project, a classified satellite, into deep space. He admitted it.
(1:53:21)</p>
<p>He told the public that. Okay, so we have objects, we have space satellites out there, and they&#x27;re detecting things coming in all the time. But the government doesn&#x27;t want us to know, or doesn&#x27;t want you to know, that we have these deep space probes. So they can&#x27;t disclose methods or sources of information of how these things are being detected.
(1:53:42)</p>
<p>Now, the Navy said, we&#x27;re not going to disclose any more of these videos. The Air Force said the same thing.
Well, the Air Force never did disclose theirs. The Air Force has 110 of them sitting in a classified vault that would scare the dickens out of anyone that saw them. But they&#x27;re not going to disclose them. And so the Coast Guard, the United States Coast Guard has them.
(1:54:16)</p>
<p>They don&#x27;t have jets. They have C-130 cargo planes, and rescue planes, and helicopters. And one over the northwest off Vancouver Island, for 40 minutes, they filmed these two spacecraft, alien spacecraft, flying saucers, as what the pilot and the co-pilot said, flying around their helicopters. They filmed it.
(1:54:43)</p>
<hr>
<p>Well, that&#x27;s classified. It was taken over by the Navy, and the Navy says that&#x27;s classified.
So there&#x27;s things out there, even the Canadian government, the Canadian Air Force has things that they&#x27;re not going to disclose, that have happened, that they&#x27;ve filmed. So we have to get we have to get the government, we have to get Congress to put pressure on the military to release these things.
(1:55:16)</p>
<p>Now, I understand that there&#x27;s a different branch, because the military is in the executive branch, but there&#x27;s things that you can, methods that Congress can take to put pressure on the military to release some of this stuff. Now, if we still had Harry Reid around, God bless his soul, and he was still in the Senate, I think he could have done it.
(1:55:40)</p>
<p>But unfortunately, we don&#x27;t have anybody in the Senate now, in leadership, that will do that. Because supposedly, Schumer, Dick Schumer, and McConnell, were briefed to keep their mouth shut. That&#x27;s what one of the senators told us, and they won&#x27;t even bring it up in the Senate. So that&#x27;s what we have right now.
(1:56:14)</p>
<p>We&#x27;re making our efforts to get disclosure inside government. But at this time right now, there&#x27;s a block. There&#x27;s a roadblock ahead of us. Now, the ODNI report that came out last August, was that well-crafted wordsmith disinformation? Yeah, I would say so. Absolutely. I mean, it caused the conversation to swing in another direction. In another direction, exactly.
Yeah. And we&#x27;ve also missed, and I&#x27;ve been watching some of the chatter out there from some very interesting accounts, about the missing of the report that we were supposed to already have this year. Now we&#x27;re sitting on, today is September 14th, we missed the six-month window.
(1:57:06)</p>
<p>There&#x27;s allegedly one that&#x27;s going to come out around Halloween, October, late October. And I&#x27;m wondering how that&#x27;s going to be worded. And, you know, again, because you&#x27;re guiding the masses with this, and engaging the comments, not only here in the UFO community, but to our adversaries around the world. Well, we&#x27;re working with a senator who has informed us that some of the information that they were going to disclose in a report, they had to clear it through the military.
(1:57:58)</p>
<p>The military extracted, redacted many paragraphs in that. And I don&#x27;t know how long the document was, but they redacted it. So all the good stuff, all the meat of that report that was supposed to come out in September, has been redacted by the government, by the military, by the intelligence community, because it discloses sources and methods, which I don&#x27;t think it does.
(1:58:25)</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know, I didn&#x27;t read it. I don&#x27;t know what it contained. But some of the aides, some of the staff members who had clearances, tried to write it in a manner that was avoiding any kind of classification. But the government didn&#x27;t, I guess the military didn&#x27;t want it, or the U.S. intelligence didn&#x27;t want it.
(1:58:56)</p>
<p>So I don&#x27;t know where we are right now. What about the second, is there going to be a second UFO hearing? And will it be by the House, or will it kick up a level to the Senate, and the Intelligence Committee? It&#x27;s supposed to be the Senate. They had a plan for the Senate to hold hearings, because the first one was Congress, the House of Representatives. This one is supposed to be done by the Senate, the Senate Intelligence Committee. But that was blocked by Chuck Schumer, who&#x27;s in charge of the Senate right now, I guess because of what&#x27;s occurring within the government.
(1:59:40)</p>
<p>And they want to keep some of these other things, the January 6th hearings, and things like that open, more open and available. And plus, the senators are going to be leaving here shortly for campaigning, because there&#x27;s an election this year. So I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re going to see it. And unfortunately, we&#x27;re not going to see it.
(2:00:00)</p>
<hr>
<p>I think the Senate hearings, because we were more involved, our group was more involved in that, in our Senate hearing. And we were going to really, we had some excellent questions that we were going to pose to whoever the intelligence community placed in front of the hearing. And I understand there was going to be a general, an Air Force general and somebody from the Department of Defense. But I don&#x27;t think those hearings are going to materialize at this point, which is a very, I mean, it&#x27;s frustrating to people out here who really want disclosure.
(2:00:38)</p>
<p>I mean, we could have disclosure without disrupting the intelligence community, about disrupting research and development. Just the fact that yes, we&#x27;ve been visited, we have obtained materials from the ETs, just those things, those basic things that we want to know, the public wants to know. And we can do disclosure without harming the government.
And how it was collected and anything else that would be there in the interest of national security, certainly.

<p>You want to know a secret? I love ponies. I really love ponies. I&#x27;m serious.
I couldn&#x27;t stay sane without ponies to brush.
Why Fade to Black? Because you never got that pony, dammit!
This is Fade to Black with Jimmy Church on the Game Changer Radio Network. Welcome back, Fade to Black. I&#x27;m your host, Jimmy Church. Tonight, Rick Doty is with us.
I can&#x27;t handle it.
(2:05:22)</p>
<p>I can&#x27;t take it anymore. Man, incredible. Incredible, Rick. What a great conversation tonight. And I want to flip things around, if I can. Recently, John Greenwald and the Black Vault presented a video that I watched about... I&#x27;m just going to call it... I don&#x27;t have the exact name, and I&#x27;ll leave that up to John. But it&#x27;s a document, and everybody can go and watch it over on the YouTube channel.
(2:05:58)</p>
<p>It&#x27;s an operations manual guide on classifications and dealing with UAP. And in this guide, I&#x27;m going to paraphrase, go and watch John&#x27;s video because it&#x27;s excellent.
But that all UAP data, everything needs to be classified. This stuff doesn&#x27;t need to go out into the public, and if that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s dealing with... And now I&#x27;m paraphrasing, but the overall arching writer&#x27;s author of this, and this is for the Department of Defense and for the three-letter agencies, I think that this is a pretty big deal.
(2:06:45)</p>
<p>The community itself, I don&#x27;t think, is as aware of it as they should be. But does that alarm you that this kind of document is written and who wrote it? And I&#x27;m wondering if the author of this could possibly, you know, be out there on social media and gauging things and seeing how stuff is being dealt with, and they just want to just close this UAP issue down. Well, classification authority rests with a number of different agencies.
(2:07:16)</p>
<p>People can... different agencies can classify things. But the governing directive is DOD regulation 5200, and that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re talking about. It dictates when something needs to be classified, how it&#x27;s supposed to be classified, whether it&#x27;s going to be top secret with the caveats, with special access, whether it&#x27;s going to be secret or confidential, which is the lowest classification you can get.
(2:07:52)</p>
<p>And then there&#x27;s, of course, special categories such as if it dealt with nuclear weapons, it would be restricted data and so forth and so on.
Anyways, I get you, and I do think that this is the danger when the government starts thinking that everything, especially anything to do with UAPs, will be classified. That&#x27;s ridiculous, number one. It&#x27;s already out there in the public.
(2:08:21)</p>
<p>The TikTak videos, the Nimitz incident, the Roosevelt incident, some of these other incidents that have been filmed and released, that&#x27;s in the public. It&#x27;s very difficult to come back and say... Put the genie back in the bottle. Yeah, right, right. Yeah, so yeah, it worries me.
It really worries me that the government is collapsing, I think, because of Space Force, that now they&#x27;re going to classify everything.
(2:09:00)</p>
<p>And what do you make of this? Okay, what&#x27;s going on today in a very small segment, I might add, of social media? It&#x27;s not all of ufology. But the ability to get UFO researchers that have been at this game for a long time, ufology is decades old. It&#x27;s not Twitter old, right? It&#x27;s not social media old.
(2:09:27)</p>
<hr>
<p>But this is something that was very effective in the past, was to get different researchers with different ideas and different data in fighting, right? And that&#x27;s very effective, right? And I see that going on today. It&#x27;s straight from the playbook, isn&#x27;t it?
Oh, absolutely. There&#x27;s more harm done from within the UFO community to themselves than anybody could done the outside.
(2:10:08)</p>
<p>Like Phil Klass said at that UFO convention in 2006, you people do more harm fighting amongst themselves than I could ever do from the outside.
I mean, and that&#x27;s true. And it&#x27;s true. I just get a kick out of these UFO conventions. And you and I have been there. And we&#x27;ve listened to some of these people argue back and forth over something because of a book or something like that.
(2:10:39)</p>
<p>And so they do more harm. I mean, if the UFO community could unite, I mean, fully unite behind a legitimate disclosure program, I think that would help the government seeing this. But listening to even during those hearings, those congressmen, they got their questions from UFO people. And some of the questions, you could read those questions, where they came from.
(2:11:21)</p>
<p>Yeah. And now our group is doing the same thing. I mean, we&#x27;re forming questions for the senators to ask. And so we&#x27;re probably just as blamed, much as blamed. But we&#x27;re centering our questions around really legitimate events that happened. And let these people not... we&#x27;re not talking generalities or philosophies. We&#x27;re talking about actual events.
(2:11:51)</p>
<p>And we want to know about these events. We want to know really what happened at Roswell. I mean, I read about it. I know what happened. Let&#x27;s talk about Randall Syme Forest. Let&#x27;s see what really happened there that is still classified. I mean, the OSI report is still classified top secret. It&#x27;s not going to be disclosed. And the portion that was released, the 63 pages, 54 were redacted all black.
(2:12:19)</p>
<p>You can&#x27;t read anything. You can&#x27;t even tell where it happened. So we need to... these things happened before. They happened in the past.
Let&#x27;s start disclosure with what happened in the past and then work up to the present time.
That&#x27;s the legitimate method we think disclosure should work. Now, there&#x27;s another thing that&#x27;s going on in social media.
(2:12:49)</p>
<p>And it&#x27;s cross platforms. It&#x27;s all there. You are going to... the UFO community in general does not trust anybody involved with the government, the Department of Defense, because they&#x27;ve been ridiculed for years. They have been teased.
They have been lied to. And trust is something that is going to come over time. It&#x27;s not going happen in a couple of years.
(2:13:15)</p>
<p>It&#x27;s just not going to be there. And then when you see what is going on with the UFO hearings and these reports and these claims coming out of, you know, the Navy and the Department of Defense and these statements that Washington is now our friend, that&#x27;s not going to happen overnight.
(2:13:37)</p>
<p>And I see this ebb and flow going on in social media and comments from others that there is no way. If disclosure happens, that&#x27;s fine. And we&#x27;ve got to keep the pressure on. But there is nobody associated with Washington, D.C. that is our friend.
(2:13:51)</p>
<hr>
<p>Oh, I agree with you 100 percent, Jimmy. You&#x27;re right, right? You&#x27;re right. And what can we do? How can we unite the UFO community?
We tried. I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;ve spoke at conventions. I&#x27;ve befriended a lot of people that really were against me. I&#x27;ve moved closer. I interact with people. You know, you and I years ago wouldn&#x27;t have been friends.
(2:14:31)</p>
<p>We&#x27;re friends now. I love you, Jimmy. I mean, you&#x27;re a great guy. We have our differences in the past, but we can sit down and talk like men to men. You know, hey, this is what I&#x27;ve done and this is what I admit to. There&#x27;s a lot of things I did in the past. And I&#x27;ll admit that that wasn&#x27;t pleasant, but I had a job to do. I was told to do this.
(2:14:48)</p>
<p>And so and there&#x27;s people out there that are like me that want the truth out there and want it presented in a way that is believable. And the government, I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re going to do it. You know, and the government plays, like you said earlier, they play the UFO community against each other. It&#x27;s easy to do. It&#x27;s a different disinformation campaign, but it&#x27;s the easiest disinformation campaign you could ever run because of social media. You can plant one particular UFO group against another or one particular person within the UFO group against another.
(2:15:41)</p>
<p>It&#x27;s easy to do. And I think the government, when they want to generate some animosity amongst the UFO group, that&#x27;s exactly what they do. Well, I noticed something probably about six, seven years ago, you know, before TTSA, before the current drama, and how funny that TTSA is gone, right? With everything that happened in 2017, here we are, didn&#x27;t take long to have that go away.
(2:16:15)</p>
<p>But before all of that, I would hear comments from people going, Jimmy, somebody just said, you know, they would say my name. I said, what? I had nothing, you know, I&#x27;m like, wait a minute. And then I would hear it again. I&#x27;d hear it again.
And I stepped back, Rick, I swear on all that is holy. I stepped back and went, there&#x27;s games being played.
(2:16:42)</p>
<p>There are games being played. People saying things, you know, and that I know that I didn&#x27;t speak to that person, or I didn&#x27;t say this, or I didn&#x27;t do that, that it was all BS. But, and it continues right now, right through 2022. And I, you know, and I just see it.
(2:17:04)</p>
<p>And it&#x27;s not just with me, it&#x27;s with a whole variety of people, where this is, this is going on. And, you know, and I know the sources, you know, it&#x27;s very easy to triangulate this stuff back. And, and all I do is operate with squinty eyes, you know, and see how this plays out.
Well, there&#x27;s, you know, there&#x27;s a lot of people that don&#x27;t like me, but there&#x27;s, there&#x27;s a lot of people that don&#x27;t like you too, Jimmy. Because when, when the word got out that was going on your show, I got a lot of emails saying, why do you want to go on Jimmy&#x27;s show?
(2:17:37)</p>
<p>Why do you want to go on Fade to Black? I said, I like Jimmy. I&#x27;ve, you know, I&#x27;ve been fences with him. I&#x27;ve been to UFO conventions. I&#x27;ve been, I mean, I, I don&#x27;t know if we should say we got drunk together, but we did, but, but, you know, you, you, I, you air it the way it&#x27;s supposed to be aired.
(2:18:07)</p>
<p>There&#x27;s other people out there that don&#x27;t. And I think people discredit you because you ask a lot of questions. You don&#x27;t, you&#x27;re not gullible. Yeah. And, and, and here&#x27;s the other thing. I&#x27;m not here to ruffle feathers and I, I don&#x27;t, I don&#x27;t cause trouble. It&#x27;s not in my nature. I&#x27;m, I&#x27;m more about learning and I, and I&#x27;m trying to get to, you know, the end of the road on this thing.
(2:18:37)</p>
<p>And that&#x27;s, that&#x27;s my goal. And that frustrates people that, and, and, and, and I get it. I can&#x27;t be bought. I can&#x27;t, well, send me a guitar. I&#x27;ll get you on the show. But, but, but I&#x27;m not a show. I am my own person. And there are people out there that are very frustrated about that.
(2:19:03)</p>
<p>They don&#x27;t get it. If Rick, this is the truth. And I&#x27;m not in any way speaking from an egocentric state of mind here. If anybody walked a day in my shoes and saw what I actually did, they would have a completely different opinion. A completely, they, oh, okay. Completely different.
(2:19:20)</p>
<hr>
<p>And, but, but they can&#x27;t and they don&#x27;t. So they write their own idea of what&#x27;s really going on and who I am. And, and because I don&#x27;t, I don&#x27;t run my mouth and, and, and say things out in public.
I&#x27;m not posting in social media. I&#x27;m not, you know what I mean? I don&#x27;t do that. So they don&#x27;t have any ammunition to say anything.
(2:19:51)</p>
<p>So they make it up and it&#x27;s just the way it is. And here&#x27;s the other thing that really pisses people off. I don&#x27;t give a crap. I don&#x27;t give a crap. I don&#x27;t see it. I don&#x27;t read it. I don&#x27;t hear it. I don&#x27;t watch your stuff. I don&#x27;t read your stuff. I don&#x27;t I just don&#x27;t, I don&#x27;t give a crap.
(2:20:14)</p>
<p>You know, this show is just done with you and I talking and that&#x27;s it without any outside influences. That&#x27;s it. That&#x27;s it. It makes people angry.
Oh, it does. It does. Especially knowing you don&#x27;t really give a shit about, excuse me.
I do. I don&#x27;t, I don&#x27;t, I don&#x27;t give a shit. I do not.
I don&#x27;t know how to say this. I never swear on this show, but you know, okay. All right.
(2:20:38)</p>
<p>Everybody just freaked out. Jimmy just said the bad version of poo-poo. Well, we, we gotta have a voice out there. And I like your voice. I mean, I&#x27;ve listened to your show a lot. And you know, you have good guests and some I believe, some I don&#x27;t. You know, and I&#x27;m up front with somebody if I don&#x27;t, don&#x27;t believe them.
(2:21:07)</p>
<p>And I like, I like to be, I like that to be. Well, and then there&#x27;s other entities, other ways to get, get the word out.
And I think you know, I, I, I work at Gaia as you will be. I don&#x27;t know if I should say that or not, but... That&#x27;s dis-info. That&#x27;s dis-info right there. You were given misinformation. Okay. But continue. But, but you know, Gaia has a good, a cosmic disclosure with Emory Smith. I&#x27;ve been on there for several years.
(2:21:48)</p>
<p>I have like 45 episodes. And some with, with somebody else, another person. I&#x27;ve, I&#x27;ve traveled the world. I&#x27;ve been to UK speaking, going back to the UK in October. I&#x27;m trying to get the word out. I&#x27;m trying to get the word out. You know, I don&#x27;t use people anymore, such as Bill Moore or Jamie Shandera, as disinformation people.
That&#x27;s, that era&#x27;s over with.
(2:22:23)</p>
<p>I try to convince people of that. I&#x27;m, I&#x27;m the legitimate Rick Doty now. I&#x27;m, I&#x27;m not, I don&#x27;t spread disinformation. I couldn&#x27;t have, I couldn&#x27;t be at Gaia. I couldn&#x27;t have worked for the Institute for Advanced Studies the years that I worked there if, if I was one, if I was that bad person.
(2:22:42)</p>
<p>So I want to get the word out. I want to get disclosure out in the best way we can. I want to get everything that we, we&#x27;ve done, that we can legitimately talk about within the UFO community. Everything that we&#x27;ve, that, that we, the United States government, United States intelligence community has done from 1947, from the Roswell Crohn incident up until now.
(2:23:12)</p>
<p>How we do this, we have to do it in a, in a, in a way that the, the public will become involved with. Rather than telling the public, we should grasp the public&#x27;s assistance and, and, and getting this out. And I&#x27;m doing a good job at it because I, you know, I used to get a lot of hate mail, but now our emails, now I get people who want to, want to help.
(2:23:43)</p>
<p>What can we do to get the word out? I said, you need to contact your, contact your Senator or Congressman and tell them you want, you want to know about this. You have a right as a United States citizen to know what our government&#x27;s been doing.
(2:23:54)</p>
<hr>
<p>I wanted to before, and by the way, I don&#x27;t care what you&#x27;re doing in the morning, we&#x27;re doing overtime. So, and that&#x27;s going to come up here shortly. So, but anyway, you had mentioned earlier, I don&#x27;t want, I don&#x27;t need a lawsuit. I don&#x27;t need names. So keep that part.
(2:24:22)</p>
<p>You said that there is somebody that you have been trying to out that is, is active right now in, in social media and in the community. Is there, you had mentioned on this show, it was probably four or five years ago now, that there were a couple of speakers in, in, in the UFO conference circuit that, that were agents, that were informants.
(2:24:52)</p>
<p>Yes. Is, is that going on today? I mean, is there, are there active members of Ufology that may not be who they say they are? Oh, yeah.
Yeah. I&#x27;m not going to mention names, but I know of three who are cooperating. I should say, yeah, they&#x27;re cooperating assets for, for, for the U.S. intelligence service.
(2:25:27)</p>
<p>And what&#x27;s their job? Well, their job is to report back what, what their group, what their UFO group, the ones I know are with, are in MUFON. And, and I, I know who they are. I talked to them. They don&#x27;t really, well, one of them kind of hides it.
(2:25:50)</p>
<p>The other two don&#x27;t really hide it. I mean, they, they&#x27;re, they&#x27;re not saying they work for the U.S. intelligence, but what they say is, I don&#x27;t have anything to hide. I&#x27;ll tell anyone this. I don&#x27;t have anything to hide. And, but I know, I know things about them that will, will say, will tell me that they, they work, they have a handling agent, so to speak.
(2:26:11)</p>
<p>They&#x27;re reporting back. And, and that&#x27;s, you know, it&#x27;s, it&#x27;s only common sense that any, any group that is, that could obtain information relevant to research and technology or UFO activities, the government would want to know about it. So they&#x27;re going to penetrate groups and they&#x27;re going to have somebody in that group report back to them, just like I did with Bill Moore. I mean, I recruited Bill Moore. He was in APRO, you know, before MUFON, MUFON and APRO, APRO doesn&#x27;t exist now.
(2:26:56)</p>
<p>He was also in CAUSE and, and I recruited him to report back to me everything that was going on within the UFO community regarding UFOs. And, and he did, he was one of my sources. And, and that hasn&#x27;t changed today. They&#x27;re still doing the same thing because I talk and, and I think we sat at the last UFO convention.
(2:27:19)</p>
<p>And I think I pointed out to you who the intelligence officers were in the crowd. There were three of them. And, and so they still go that US intelligence, either air force or, or, or DIA or even CIA, they go to these conventions.
Now, if they thought this was a, a, a non believable or a, a hoax, why would they send top line intelligence officers to these UFO conventions?
(2:27:50)</p>
<p>Well, okay. But there&#x27;s, there&#x27;s two ways to look at this. One is that they&#x27;re collecting information to see what we know. Okay. There&#x27;s that. But then there&#x27;s the other side is they can be telling stories. Absolutely. Exactly. Exactly. You hit it right there, Jimmy. They&#x27;re telling stories. They&#x27;re spreading information. They&#x27;re spreading information.
(2:28:14)</p>
<hr>
<p>And what is that? That&#x27;s the misinformation. That&#x27;s the misinformation of a disinformation campaign.
Yeah. It&#x27;ll spread around a UFO conference pretty quickly too. I&#x27;ve had it happen. I&#x27;ve had, where I&#x27;ve had two or three people come up to me and go, so I just heard. And I was like, yeah, I&#x27;ve heard it now four times.
(2:28:41)</p>
<p>It&#x27;s crazy how effective that is. I mean, it&#x27;s, well, you could do the same thing in sports. You could do the same thing in, in a search engine company, right? Whatever. You want to just go and, and, and get something going. You can get it going pretty quickly. And it&#x27;s, it&#x27;s very interesting how, you know, the sewing circles, you know, the little guy, you know, boom. And it, and it, it proliferates so fast. But I&#x27;m very curious.
(2:29:08)</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know. Rick hasn&#x27;t told me, so don&#x27;t ask and, and, and things, but, but I&#x27;m very curious who, it&#x27;s one thing to collect information, but who is out there, who&#x27;s putting it out there into the UFO community. I&#x27;m very interested in that. I&#x27;ve got some ideas, you know, but that part doesn&#x27;t matter, but I can see the, this ebb and flow.
(2:29:36)</p>
<p>And, and it&#x27;s very easy to, you know, connect the dots, right. To triangulate, to GPS this thing. Well, I think your listeners who are within MUFON or the UFO community probably have a few ideas on, on, on these people. And I&#x27;m not going to disclose them. It&#x27;s their business. They&#x27;re out there doing their, their job, maybe, or I&#x27;m not going to disclose names, but they are there and they always will be somebody within these groups that are reporting back to US intelligence of what the group is doing or what new information they&#x27;ve gotten from new incidents that happened to you, both landings or ET contacts or abductions.
(2:30:25)</p>

(2:36:20)</p>
<p>Wow. What a show tonight. I just... Art Bell. Art Bell. Bob Lazar. Just... Just mind blown tonight. Hang on.
Sometimes I just drink too much coffee during the break.
Overtime, Rick Doty. Overtime. Okay, now let&#x27;s loosen up a little bit.
(2:36:47)</p>
<hr>
<p>And I want to go here.
Serpo. Misinformation, disinformation, government-funded campaign. What was it?
Well... It&#x27;s a yes or no question, Rick. A little bit of both, I guess.
You know, that&#x27;s a story and it&#x27;s... I mean, that&#x27;s a complex story.
If you go back and look at all the different players involved in this, Victor Martinez and Joe Yeager and... I mean, you know, I could name them forever.
(2:37:28)</p>
<p>And then me, I was feeding information off or getting information off other people.
Obviously, I wasn&#x27;t around back in those days. I was a kid.
But there&#x27;s some people that will swear by it.
And then there&#x27;s some people will say, no, it was a disinformation campaign to scare the Russians. We wanted the Russians to think that we had contact with an extraterrestrial race and that would scare the Russians. Now, I think part of that&#x27;s true. I think we did let the Russians know.
(2:38:18)</p>
<p>But on the other hand, there&#x27;s a lot of things that can be verified that happened.
And there are people out there, unfortunately, they died, they&#x27;re dead.
But there was one person out there who spoke from the heart about it happening.
Although there&#x27;s a controversy about how many people went, whether it were 12 or three or one.
I know Linda Howell spoke many times about the Serpo or about what she knew and about the one person that she had contact with who had supposedly went.
(2:39:01)</p>
<p>And it came back. So I think there&#x27;s a little bit of facts in a bucket that&#x27;s mostly a counterintelligence operation.
Why would they try to mislead, excuse me, mislead the Russians in something like this and having the Russians believe that we were sending and trading personnel with a planet called Serpo?
I mean, what&#x27;s to gain with the Russians believing a story like that?
(2:39:47)</p>
<p>Well, there&#x27;s a number of different facets to that.
Number one, if the Russians were to believe that we had contact with an extraterrestrial race, that would mean that the extraterrestrial race could be providing us with advanced weapons or advanced research technology. And that would scare the Russians, number one, thinking that we had something they didn&#x27;t have as far as a weapons system goes or even space travel.
(2:40:24)</p>
<p>And the Russians back in the 60s had somewhat of an advantage on human intelligence, a human meaning spies. We had an open society. They didn&#x27;t. It was easy for them to keep track of their people. It was not easy for us to keep track of our people.
I know in an intelligence operations course, we learn history.
(2:41:01)</p>
<p>And one of the things we learned was that from the 50s on through the 60s, the Soviets had an easy job of keeping track of our spies. And we had a difficult job of keeping track of their spies. So I think that all played into this thing that, hey, we got something that you don&#x27;t have. And I think that&#x27;s part of the operation. Although I don&#x27;t know for a fact. I know CIRPL means something to U.S. intelligence.
(2:41:44)</p>
<p>The word CIRPL, it&#x27;s something to do with special extraterrestrial planet or something. There&#x27;s an actual meaning of CIRPL, which just came out here a little while ago. Somebody brought it to my attention that I didn&#x27;t know about. So... So you&#x27;re suggesting it would be possible to FOIA CIRPL documents? Hmm. You know, people have tried. I know there is one document that DIA released to Bill Ryan, who he was one of the... Administrators. Administrator that had information about CIRPL, but it was heavily redacted.
(2:42:36)</p>
<p>Actually, it was not about CIRPL, it was about Project Crystal Night, because that was the project. I remember. It had nothing to do with CIRPL. The document pertained to Crystal Night, and it was a space program being run by the National Security Agency. And but the document was really heavily redacted, so you couldn&#x27;t really make a whole lot out of it.
(2:43:09)</p>
<hr>
<p>So that&#x27;s the only thing that I can remember anybody getting from the CIRPL story was Bill Ryan&#x27;s. And he showed that to me, showed it to other people and wanted to know if I could, you know, maybe read between the lines, but it was too heavily redacted. I just don&#x27;t know what it was about.
(2:43:39)</p>
<p>Now, I mentioned at the beginning of the show, Project Blue Book being a bona fide disinformation, misinformation campaign. I think history is going to, you know, just continue down that path with it. For you, is that some of the best evidence of the Air Force running misdirection directly with the American public when it came to UFOs?
Oh, yeah, I think initially, it was a program.
(2:44:12)</p>
<p>The reason that they changed, you know, changed names from Grudge, eventually to Blue Book, was that there was different administrators with different objectives. And I know my uncle, Edward Doty, was involved with the Project Blue Book. He was an investigator. And he told me stories about why they changed the name and the differences between an open investigation of something that they can could read readily identify as being an answer to the to a question of what was that in the sky to the more mysterious cases, which they couldn&#x27;t answer, didn&#x27;t have an answer to, and how they classified.
(2:45:10)</p>
<p>And so, as you as you said, it&#x27;s a form of a disinformation campaign, because not one single case, not one single case that the government talked about was identified as a as a legitimate extraterrestrial craft or extraterrestrial contact.
Those cases were classified. They were classified top secret. And they went on to somebody else to investigate. The field investigators only investigated cases of known astronomical objects. And let&#x27;s face it, most of what the people were seeing could be easily identified as a plane, as a research and development plane, or as the Venus, the planet Venus, or other things.
(2:46:15)</p>
<p>And so, but the ones that couldn&#x27;t be, they&#x27;re the ones that that the government&#x27;s not going to come out public and say, Listen, I got all these cases here, these 700 cases, 701, 701 cases that we can&#x27;t identify. And every indication is that they&#x27;re extraterrestrial in nature. They&#x27;re not going to say that, although that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re saying privately, or in the classified documents, that&#x27;s exactly what they&#x27;re saying.
(2:46:41)</p>
<p>But they&#x27;re not going to release that stuff. Okay, and I think that I think that we all understand that. But my point, and thank you for that. But my point to the audience, when we talk about misinformation or disinformation, I have these are direct. I mean, these are things that you can go and research and follow up on your own.
(2:47:12)</p>
<p>And Blue Book and Serpo, certainly, the internet version of Serpo and Martinez and what was going on and all of the players, I don&#x27;t want to get into the list of names and the aviary and all of that. But it was it was a very concentrated, comprehensive campaign that was in play. It wasn&#x27;t real. And elements of it possibly being real, but it was misinformation.
(2:47:39)</p>
<p>It was disinformation direct right to the public on the internet. And, and I was I was in the middle of it. Rick, I was right there, man. I was reading those updates every single day. I couldn&#x27;t wait for you to give some more information to Martinez. Okay. Okay. So, you know what I wish I wish I had the mind to do that.
(2:48:00)</p>
<p>I&#x27;d be a millionaire now. I&#x27;d be writing science fiction books. Whoever wrote that stuff. That&#x27;s right. Now you just hit the nail on the head. It was some of the best science fiction ever. Some very creative writers were behind that for sure. Rick Doty being one. So, let&#x27;s talk about MJ-12. Again, in your opinion, I&#x27;ve already stated mine, misinformation, disinformation campaign out of Washington, D.C.? Yeah, that those documents were created were created at the special means committee within the DIA. Now, some of the information is legitimate.
(2:48:50)</p>
<p>I mean, you can you can verify names and dates and places and you can you can find out who was where and things sure, but but the majority of it was a was a disinformation, I would say. Now, there are other people out there that will say no, but I think that part of that was a disinformation campaign to belittle the UFO community, the people that got it.
(2:49:25)</p>
<p>Okay, okay. You gotta understand who got it.
(2:49:26)</p>

<p>Let&#x27;s go right there. That envelope with the original film role, right? That was sent to Jamie Shandoray here in Burbank. You were involved at that time with William Moore, correct? With Bill Moore. Did you know that that envelope was put in the mail?
No, absolutely not. No, Bill Moore contacted me and said, Jamie got a canister, a film canister that he had developed because he was the photographer, he had his own development studio. And he said, and it contained a classified document. I said, what are you talking about, Bill?
(2:50:19)</p>
<p>And he said, no, no, no, no, tell me. I know it. So I said, well, let me go check and find out.
That&#x27;s my question. Did you go and check?
Well, I went into the intelligence community and I said, anybody, you know, anybody send Jamie Shandoray some kind of film canister? Is this part of an operation or what? And nobody that within my circle said yes.
(2:50:52)</p>
<p>They said, I don&#x27;t know. We don&#x27;t know. It could have happened up in headquarters, but it didn&#x27;t happen down in the field. So I said, no, Bill, I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re talking about. And I said, it&#x27;s probably, you know, Jamie, Jamie exaggerated so much stuff. I mean, I could tell you stories about Jamie that is just ridiculous. But anyways, I said, well, let me fly out there and find out.
(2:51:17)</p>
<p>So I go out there. Well, Jamie, the Jamie didn&#x27;t want to show it to me. You&#x27;re talking about you flew to Los Angeles. Yeah. Yeah. I flew to Burbank, John Wayne Airport. Okay. Costa Mesa, I guess the Costa Mesa, right? Yeah. Anyways, I went there and we drove to Jamie&#x27;s place. And Jamie said, well, I&#x27;m not really sure if I should show it to you because I got it.
(2:51:46)</p>
<p>I said, well, Jamie, if you want me to verify what this is. And then I started thinking that Jamie just bullshitting us. And so finally, Jamie, you know, went in and he had it in a secret place. He brings it out, shows it to me. And I look at it. I said, wow, this is something else. I said, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s real or not.
(2:52:14)</p>
<p>I mean, I know some of it sounds legitimate, but I don&#x27;t know all of it, if all of it is. I said, why don&#x27;t you let me take it? And no, no, no, no, no, no, no, you can&#x27;t take it. I said, you know what, Jamie, I&#x27;m still a federal agent. I could seize this from you because it&#x27;s classified.
(2:52:32)</p>
<p>It has top secret on it. I said, you don&#x27;t have the right to know it, Jamie. And he said, okay, okay, okay, okay. You can take it, but let me make a copy. I said, no, you&#x27;re not going to make any copies of it. So, I take it. I go back to Kirtland. I make a copy. Because it was top secret, I couriered it.
(2:52:59)</p>
<p>All top secret documents back in those days had to be transmitted by the Armed Forces Courier Service. So, you know, I scheduled that. They come and get it, you know, handcuff on wrist and a briefcase and one of those things and they took it up there. Well, about four or five days later, a colonel called me and said, why did you send this up to, back to us? I said, well, I got it from you.
(2:53:23)</p>
<p>Okay. So, that was the source. Bingo. Right. The Pentagon. I said, yeah, it was OSI. It&#x27;s called a special, yeah, it&#x27;s a, no, it&#x27;s a DIA. Okay. Special means committee. Special means committee.
(2:53:44)</p>
<hr>
<p>Now, the special means committee, I knew they created bogus documents. Most of them went to Soviet Union, Chinese intelligence operations. And I said, they said, why did you send it back?
I said, because I got it from a guy in California who somebody mailed it to him. He said, leave it at that, Mr. Doty, just leave it at that. I said, you want me to give it back to him?
(2:54:12)</p>
<p>Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. How, so, you, you returned, Jamie didn&#x27;t make copies. Jamie Shandoray, everybody&#x27;s a producer, back here in Hollywood, back in the day, and he worked with Bill Moore. And so, that&#x27;s who Jamie Shandoray is. So, he didn&#x27;t make any copies. You took the originals of that. But what about the film role? So, Jamie still had that, right?
No, I took everything. I took everything.
(2:54:44)</p>
<p>Oh, you took everything. Okay. So, you returned that to Jamie?
I did exactly what I was told to do. I took it all the way back. Actually, what I did was I met, I met Jamie and Bill in Prescott, Arizona. And I turned everything over to them. I said, you know, Jamie, I guess you&#x27;re supposed to have this.
(2:55:11)</p>
<p>And then Jamie mentioned a person who was another agent, but in California, out of Norton Air Force Base, which is a Riverside area. And I said, oh, you know him? His first name is Steve. And Jamie said, yes, I&#x27;m working with Steve. I said, okay, I&#x27;m out of it. And that&#x27;s the chain of events. Now, it went a long ways after that, because Bill Moore got a hold of it.
(2:55:42)</p>
<p>And then Bill tried to verify it. And then... Stan Freedman gets involved.
Freedman. Yeah. Well, Stan Freedman, I was at a... I can&#x27;t remember what I was doing.
Anyways, I was in Houston, Texas. And Stan Freedman was there. And he was talking to somebody.
I can&#x27;t remember. He had an interview with somebody. No, not Houston, Austin. He had an interview with Bobby Inman and intelligence. He was DIA at the time. And Stan had a copy of it.
(2:56:20)</p>
<p>Stan says, I want to show you something. He goes back to his hotel room. He had it in a sealed area and he pulls it out. He said, did you ever see this? I said, matter of fact, I have.
So anyways, and it went around from there.
It&#x27;s a difficult thing for the UFO community.
(2:56:48)</p>
<p>There are so many smart people and so many researchers that analyzed every single, not only word, letter, down to the letter, typefaces, the way documents were prepared, how addresses were done, how things were signed.
And you have to do that kind of analysis. And I think that the overarching, including my own eyeballs on this stuff, was that this stuff is really good.
(2:57:25)</p>
<p>So there was a team that was really good at creating authentic documents. You have to have a period typewriter, right? You&#x27;re not doing this in... well, back then it was done before computers were creating documents. So you had to sit and type this stuff out page for page and have it correct. And then you have to have the data inside of it.
(2:57:55)</p>
<p>If somebody is writing something on a specific date and their name is on it from this address, you have to make sure that that person was in that city at that time, right? And for the most part, everything lined up in the MJ-12 documents. When you were vetting specific things that you could vet, you can&#x27;t vet E.T., but you can vet the person, their title, and where they were working at that time.
(2:58:24)</p>
<p>And it all lined up. Well, that&#x27;s because it was a legitimate government document created by the government. But that&#x27;s the document. Now you have to talk about the information contained in the document. Now, is all that real? Did all that happen?
(2:58:40)</p>
<hr>
<p>That&#x27;s the question. The document itself is legitimate because the government created it, but they created it for a reason. I mean, I know people out there say, no, it&#x27;s, you know, this isn&#x27;t right and this isn&#x27;t right. Well, they just shot themselves in the foot.
They showed their ignorance because it is a government document. They created a document and they created it for a reason. Now, is it disinformation? I didn&#x27;t create the document.
(2:59:11)</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know the reason. I don&#x27;t know what they were trying to do with Jamie. I mean, but if you know the background of Jamie, you know, Jamie goes way back. I mean, Jamie was involved with the Navy, Navy Intelligence. He did, he was a source on some things for Navy Intelligence. And he created some things and he did some things that Navy Intelligence told him to do.
(2:59:40)</p>
<p>And he, you know, and then he went off the deep end and, you know, claiming that the Navy SEALs abducted him and all this stuff. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Some things have really got pretty stretched out there. And we&#x27;re, I&#x27;ve got 30 seconds left. So I will take this time to say amazing conversation tonight, Rick. Amazing. And thank you so much for taking the time from the secret location of the Red Roof Inn somewhere in the Mojave Desert. Thank you so much, Rick. And we&#x27;ll talk to you around the week. Behave and be well. And thank you.
(3:00:22)</p>
