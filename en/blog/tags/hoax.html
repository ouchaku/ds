Jacques Vallée - Trinity UFO Crash in New Mexico
October 21, 2021</p><p><a href="https://www.mysterywire.com/video/mystery-wire-jacques-vall%c3%a9e-trinity-ufo-cras" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.mysterywire.com/video/mystery-wire-jacques-vall%c3%a9e-trinity-ufo-cras</a>
h-in-new-mexico/7085654/</p><p>George Knapp: And it&#x27;s a cool story in the book, Trinity, about how they held onto that.
They put it to use. For all these years they had a use for that piece that they took out of a
crashed vehicle.</p><p>Jacques Vallee: Yes, well they were hiding it. We&#x27;re fighting about, with my colleagues,
about whether this thing is important or not. It&#x27;s a bracket similar to many brackets you
can buy for a spout of a well. In fact, I bought one. This is kind of heavy. It&#x27;s usually in
an alloy of aluminum or something else. This one I got from a shop. So they turn around
an axis and they activate their actuators here that are attached to different parts of a well
or you know, a particular machine. So those things have been around since the 30s or the
40s, 1930s.</p><p>And so it&#x27;s not very unusual. The question is what was it doing there? So my theory is,
well, the army brought it to wind up something, maybe a wire to work at night or
whatever, there is no electricity there. I used to have a Jeep to do my own UFO
investigations. And the Jeep can generate power. It was bringing power to the battlefield
and so on. So that could have come from that. They could have needed power inside the
object to clean it up or whatever they did inside at night. My friends disagree, because
there are some very, very unusual aspects to that bracket. Yeah, you can buy a bracket,
almost like it, you know, at some, some hardware store. But this is a little bit different. So
we are still investigating that and arguing about that. So there is research being done on|
that instrument.</p><p>[extraneous material omitted]</p><p>George Knapp: The Army came looking for scraps and pieces and asking people Hey,
did you find any? They wanted it back. Right?</p><p>Jacques Vallee: They wanted it back. And that&#x27;s what makes us think that it&#x27;s not just
another bracket that you can get at a hardware store in New Mexico somewhere. The
dimensions, there are holes, in the real one, there are holes like this, for an axle and so on.
The dimensions are in centimeters in the metric system. The Army, US Army was not
using the metric system in any parts that they had in 1945. So it wasn&#x27;t an Army part. It
could have come from Mexico. Mexico, I believe, uses the metric system based on the
French trades. But that&#x27;s very curious. So we&#x27;re not at the end of that, we&#x27;re at the
beginning of that study, and the book, again, Trinity, is just talking about the beginning of
it. We have a lot of work to do still.</p></div></div><p>Likewise, in Trinity: The Best-Kept Secret (Second Edition), pages 139-140, Vallee wrote:</p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-note admonition_xJq3 alert alert--secondary"><div class="admonitionHeading_Gvgb"><span class="admonitionIcon_Rf37"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M6.3 5.69a.942.942 0 0 1-.28-.7c0-.28.09-.52.28-.7.19-.18.42-.28.7-.28.28 0 .52.09.7.28.18.19.28.42.28.7 0 .28-.09.52-.28.7a1 1 0 0 1-.7.3c-.28 0-.52-.11-.7-.3zM8 7.99c-.02-.25-.11-.48-.31-.69-.2-.19-.42-.3-.69-.31H6c-.27.02-.48.13-.69.31-.2.2-.3.44-.31.69h1v3c.02.27.11.5.31.69.2.2.42.31.69.31h1c.27 0 .48-.11.69-.31.2-.19.3-.42.31-.69H8V7.98v.01zM7 2.3c-3.14 0-5.7 2.54-5.7 5.68 0 3.14 2.56 5.7 5.7 5.7s5.7-2.55 5.7-5.7c0-3.15-2.56-5.69-5.7-5.69v.01zM7 .98c3.86 0 7 3.14 7 7s-3.14 7-7 7-7-3.12-7-7 3.14-7 7-7z"></path></svg></span>引用</div><div class="admonitionContent_BuS1"><p>The shape and possible function are generally reminiscent of devices activating mobile vanes, such as the mechanism of water wells, and the mast section of windmills, for example in the Aermotor Company’s list of standard parts widely used in industry.

One of the people he made the pitch to, UFO writer Tom Carey, tape recorded the conversation. Carey kindly dug out the tape and lent it to me.</p><p>The hoaxers presented the 1946-crash story as an authentic childhood memory, just as they did with the later version. However, other than the identities of the protagonists, this original version of the story differed in every significant aspect from the later tale that Vallee adopted. In the original version, the boys were going to a different place, in a different year, by a different mode of transportation, for a different reason, and encountered a different type of crashed alien craft, after which different people did different things, compared to the later version.
However, Baca used what appears to be exactly the same aluminum bracket as a prop in both tales– although in the 1946-crash story, the alien artifact was obtained in a very different way than in the 1945-crash story.</p><p>I wrote this all up in detail in Crash Story File: The Reme Baca Smoking-Gun Interview (May 20, 2023).

Cc: Douglas Johnson douglas.dean.johnson＠gmail.com</p><p>Hi</p><p>When we chatted back on February 18, I mentioned that I was in the process of doing research for an article about
certain aspects of the &quot;Trinity&quot; UFO crash-recovery story. You told me that you were Dr. Vallee&#x27;s publicist, and you offered
to try to put me in touch with Dr. Vallee if that would be helpful. I replied that I was not yet well acquainted enough with the
source material, but that I might well take you up on the offer at the appropriate time.</p><p>After two more months and many, many hours devoted to the research, I believe that I have resolved certain issues to my
satisfaction. Some of what I found surprised me. I intend to begin to publish some of this material soon. I would
appreciate the opportunity to conduct an interview with Dr. Vallee, which might serve to clarify a couple of remaining
issues, and to acquaint Dr. Vallee with at least a couple of my findings.</p><p>What I request is an audio (telephone only) interview, all of which would be &quot;on the record.&quot; I would audio-record
the interview. I would be happy to provide the audio file intact to Dr. Vallee and/or his designees within 48 hours,
along with a machine-made transcript. (Accuracy of the machine-made transcript is erratic; obviously, I would
check any quotes I actually use in any article with the actual recording.) I believe that 30 minutes minimum would
be required to provide enough context to make the exchange worthwhile.</p><p>As to timing, late this week would work best for me -- Friday would be ideal.</p><p>In addition, there are some small questions that perhaps could easily be resolved by email, making it unnecessary to use
time during a phone interview. I have a few such questions at the moment:</p><p>(1) In August, 1945, Dr. Vallee was 5 years old. Where was he? I assume that the answer will be &quot;Pontoise, France, near
Paris.&quot; However, I learned long ago that assuming is risky, so I ask.</p><p>(2 &amp; 3) In literature about the Trinity case, there is much discussion of a metal object purportedly removed by Jose Padilla
from inside a crashed craft. The object has been referred to by those involved by various terms, including &quot;the bracket.&quot; I
simply call it &quot;the artifact,&quot; because &quot;artifact&quot; is a neutral term that conveys merely that it is not an object of natural origin;
it is manufactured. My questions are: Who is the legal owner of the artifact at this time; and, who has physical possession
or control of the artifact at this time?</p><p>I thank all involved for their consideration.</p><p>Best,</p><p>Doug</p><p>Douglas Dean Johnson</p><p>blog: Mirador

Isotopic ratios determined for nickel, copper and zinc compare to terrestrial values.”</p><p>However, perhaps wary of disappointing the client, Budinger added that even though “the isotopic radios are terrestrial, an extraterrestrial source for the metals is not ruled out...The aliens may be time travelers...The aliens may have bases on Earth and construct their craft from materials found on Earth...”</p><p>One would think that all these analyses already performed would more than suffice. But, we read on page 65 of Trinity, “Jose recently gave the piece [the artifact] to Paola, who cut off a small section for me to have analyzed.” In an email to me dated April 17, 2023, Vallee said, &quot;We have new lab analyses under review.&quot;</p><p>I can hardly wait for the lab reports.</p><p>pic</p><p>Clockwise from 1 o&#x27;clock: Remigio (Reme) Baca, Paola Harris, William P. &quot;Billy&quot; Brophy, Jacques Vallee, Joseph Lopez (Jose) Padilla.
