<p>Area 51 で軍の仕事（下請けの民間業者の仕事含む）をしていた人間の名簿を入手した。その名簿の中に Bob Lazar の名前があった。2022-09-14 の収録動画。</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="コメント">コメント<a href="https://ouchaku.github.io/ds/blog/2024/10/17/doty_area51_list#%E3%82%B3%E3%83%A1%E3%83%B3%E3%83%88" class="hash-link" aria-label="コメント への直接リンク" title="コメント への直接リンク">​</a></h2>
<p>Bob Lazar については DoD の情報撹乱工作に利用されただけなので、Area 51 に出入りしたことに何の不思議もない。</p>
<p>Art Bell については、</p>
<blockquote><p>アート・ベルはエリア51に行った。彼はネリスに行った。ベルは1979年6月17日から1979年9月19日までアクセスできた。彼はBCRSの契約社員だった... BCRSは基地のテレビ局で、閉回路テレビ局です。
(1:42:49)</p><p>...</p><p>そう。彼はそこのテレビ局と何らかの関係があったんだ。どんな理由かはわからないが、アドバイザーか、彼のために機材を用意したとか、そんな理由でね。さて、ひとつだけ、セキュリティ・クリアランスが示されていない。
(1:43:31)</p></blockquote>
<p>とあるように、軍の広報活動なり、軍内部の教育用やお偉いさん向けのビデオ<sup><a href="https://ouchaku.github.io/ds/blog/2024/10/17/doty_area51_list#user-content-fn-1-09b2f9" id="user-content-fnref-1-09b2f9" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup>の制作（ナレーション担当とか）などで Area 51 に出入りしただけだろう。</p>
<p>軍基地は巨大なので水道業者から内装業者、事務機レンタル業者、家具屋、電気工事業者と様々な業者が頻繁に出入りする。放送局の契約社員だった Art Bell が駆り出されても何の不思議もない。実際、「セキュリティ・クリアランスが示されていない」とある。ごく普通の放送関係の業務だった筈。</p>

<p>そう 数ヶ月前 私たちのグループは エリア51の管理者名簿を 手に入れました 1979年1月1日から 1990年12月31日までのものだ 古いコンピュータのドットマトリックスで、見たことがあると思いますが、24インチ幅のコンピュータのプリントアウトです。
(1:23:01)</p>
<p>そう。フォーム・フィード、フォーム・フィード・プリンター。そう、フォームフィードプリンター。3,000ページくらいある。
(1:23:07)</p>
<hr>
<p>エリア51にあった第3空軍試験飛行センター、同じエリアにあった空軍研究開発作戦センター、クリーチ空軍基地のすぐ北にあるサザン・ネリス試験場、そのエリアにある通信サイトのサイト・シドニー、そしてエリア51の実際の飛行場であるサイト・ホーミーにアクセスすることができたのは、みんな同じでした。私たちが今していることは、そのエリアに行き、その時代にそこにいたと主張する人々を見つけ出すことです。
(1:23:54)</p>
<p>1979年1月1日から1990年12月31日までの間だけです。その場所に出入りしていた全員の姓、名、ミドル・イニシャル。</p>
<hr>
<p>ボブ・ラザールも？</p>
<hr>
<p>そうだ
ボブ・ラザールはリストにあるが、ごく短期間だ。これから何人かの人物を出して、過去にさかのぼって、誰も信じたがらないが、そこにいたと主張する何人かの人物を示すことになる。
(1:24:35)</p>
<p>そしてこれには他にもたくさんの情報が載っているが、それはその期間だけのことだ。その後に誰がそこにいたのか、あるいはその前に誰がそこにいたのか、私たちは言うことができません。しかし、その期間にそこにいたと主張する多くの人々がいますが、彼らはそこにいませんでした。我々は彼らがそこにいなかったことを証明できる。
(1:24:57)</p>
<p>彼らはアクセスできなかった。今、私たちが言いたいのは、あなたの名前は載っていないということです。あなたの名前は載っていますか？ああ、名前はある。そうだ。最初に見たのは自分の名前だった。僕の名前はそこにある。私が一緒に仕事をした元諜報部員の名前もそこにある。
だから、私が話したり、私に話したり、公表した情報機関の関係者で、アニー・ジェイコブソンやアレックス・ウォードと話した人は、みんなそこに載っているんだ。アニーと話した人たちは、みんなそうだ。
(1:25:39)</p>
<p>しかも、そのうちの何人かは全期間にわたって。そして、外で何かを見たり、何かをしたりしたと、荒唐無稽な告発をしている人たちもいる。
彼らの名前はそこにはない。私たちは、あなたの名前はここに載っていないと言うだけです。
なぜ名前が載っているんだ？それについて話してもらおう。
(1:26:03)</p>
<p>そしてそれが今、私たちのプロジェクトなのです。つまり、それが私たちのプロジェクトの1つなのです。このドキュメンタリーの一部なんだ。
多くの人が関わっていて、優秀なプロデューサーや監督もいる。
COVIDのせいで遅れているんだ。私たちは撮影を中止せざるを得なかった。私たちはエリア51周辺を撮影し、トレイルカメラを設置し、エリア51やネリス試験訓練場から飛び立つすべてのものを撮影していた。素晴らしい、素晴らしいドキュメンタリーになるだろう。
(1:26:33)</p>
<p>つまり、素晴らしいドキュメンタリーになる。というのも、空軍が私たちの見たこと、やったことを理由に、私たちに対する差し止め請求を起こしたかったからです。だから、いくつかカットしなければならなかった。それとともに、そこにいたと主張する人たちを排除することになった。
(1:27:03)</p>
<p>しかしボブ・ラザールはそこにいた。つまり、彼の名前がそこにある。とても興味深い。</p>
<details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary>▼文字起こし 原文 展開</summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><p>Okay. A few months ago, well, several months ago, we, our group, got a hold of an inter-control roster for all of Area 51. The roster was dated from January 1st, 1979 to December 31st, 1990. It's on one of these old computer dot matrix, I'm sure you've seen them before, 24-inch wide computer printouts.
(1:23:01)</p><p>Right. The form feed, form feed printer. Yeah, form feed printer. There's about 3,000 pages.
(1:23:07)</p><hr><p>Everyone that had access to Det 3 Air Force Test and Test Flight Center, which was at Area 51, Air Force Research and Development Operations Center, which was right in that same area, Southern Nellis Test Range, which is just north of Creech Air Force Base, in that area there, Site Sydney, which is a communications site, and Site Homey, which is the actually airfield at Area 51. So, what we're doing now is we're going through that and we're going to out people who claim to have been there during that time period.
(1:23:54)</p><p>Now, it's only between January 1st, 1979 to December 31st, 1990. Everyone that had access to those locations, their last name, first name, middle initial. Okay, Bob Lazar, is he on that? Yes, he is.
Bob Lazar is on that list, but only for a very short period of time. And we're going to go through this and we're going to out some people and we're going to go back and show that some people who claim that they were there and nobody wants to believe them, they were there.
(1:24:35)</p><p>And this has a lot of other information on it, but it's only during that time period. Now, we can't say who was there after that or even before that, but there's a lot of people out there who claim to have been there during that time period that they weren't there. We can prove that they weren't there.
(1:24:57)</p><p>They didn't have any access. Now, all we're going to say is your name's not on it. Is your name on it? Oh, my name's on it. Yes. The first thing I looked at was my name and it's there. My name is there. And the people that I've worked with that are former retired intelligence officers that were there, their names are there too.
So everyone who claims within the intelligence community that I've spoken with or that have talked to me about it or went public, who spoke with Annie Jacobson and Alex Ward, they're on it. Every one of those people that Annie spoke with, they're on it.
(1:25:39)</p><p>And some of them for the entire period of time. And then there's some people out there who are making these wild accusations about being out there and seeing things and doing things.
Their name's not on there. And all we're going to do is say, listen, your name's not on here.
Why is it on there? Let them talk about that.
(1:26:03)</p><p>And that's what our project is right now. I mean, that's one of our projects. And that's part of this documentary that we're going to do.
There's a lot of people involved, good producers and directors involved.
It's behind the time because of COVID. We had to stop filming. We were filming all around Area 51, setting up trail cameras, filming everything that was flying out of Area 51 or the Nellis Test and Training Range. It's going to be a great, great documentary.
(1:26:33)</p><p>I mean, a fantastic documentary. Once we get it finished and we had to go back and cut some things out because the Air Force wanted to file an injunction against us because of what we saw and what we did. So we had to do some cutting out. And along with that, we're going to out these people who claimed they were there.
(1:27:03)</p><p>But Bob Lazar was there. I mean, his name's on there. Very interesting.</p></div></div></details>

<p>皮肉なことに、そこにアクセスしていたとは思いもよらないような人物、彼の名前がここに載っていますが、アート・ベルです。アート・ベルはエリア51に行った。彼はネリスに行った。ベルは1979年6月17日から1979年9月19日までアクセスできた。彼はBCRSの契約社員だった... BCRSは基地のテレビ局で、閉回路テレビ局です。
(1:42:49)</p>
<p>ここから出て行け。ああ、わかってる。私も同じことを言った。アートが死ぬ前から知ってる 彼の家に行ったこともあるし 彼の番組に出たこともある。
でもアートは、彼が外にいたなんて一言も言ってなかった。</p>
<p>そう。彼はそこのテレビ局と何らかの関係があったんだ。どんな理由かはわからないが、アドバイザーか、彼のために機材を用意したとか、そんな理由でね。さて、ひとつだけ、セキュリティ・クリアランスが示されていない。
(1:43:31)</p>
<p>彼がセキュリティクリアランスを持っていたとは書かれていない。もしかしたら、彼のために何かをセットアップするために連れてきたのかもしれない。わからない。
彼は死んだ。だから、それについて彼と話すことはできない。でも、彼はあの短い期間に外にいた。
私には手に負えない。あまり耐えられない。
私はそれを見たとき、それを扱うことができませんでした。
(1:43:53)</p>
<p>同じアート・ベルであるはずがないと思った。で、調べ始めたら、生年月日とかが全部一致したんだ。
そうか。ああ、1億もあるんだ。そうか 誤報と偽情報の話に戻ろう まるで... 道具になった気分だ。
(1:44:20)</p>
<p>こんなものを私に与えている。あなたはそれを広めている。リック、あなたは今それを広めている。すごいな。本当か？ボブ・ラザールには 理解しがたい話だ
彼は何も掴んでないだろ？すべて状況証拠だ でも、もしこれが事実で、これに文書番号があって、出所を調べて、それが何であるかを確認したんだとしたら、でもボブ・ラザーの名前があるなんて、UFOコミュニティは...。もうツイッターに投稿したんだ。オーケー。では、話を戻しましょう。
(1:45:04)</p>
<details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary>▼文字起こし 原文 展開</summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><p>Ironically, somebody who you would never think that had access out there, that had access, his name is on here, is Art Bell. Art Bell went to Area 51. He went to Nellis. Bell had access there from... well, it showed him having access on June 17, 1979, to September 19, 1979. He was a contract employee for BCRS, which is the... BCRS is the television station, the closed circuit television station for the base.
(1:42:49)</p><p>Get the hell out of here. Yeah, I know. I said the same thing. And I tell you what, I've known Art forever before he died. I mean, I've been out there to his house. I've been on his program.
And Art never mentioned that he was ever out there.
What?
Yep. Now, he was either somehow associated with the closed circuit TV station out there for I don't know what reason, maybe an advisor, maybe he set up some equipment for him or something to that. Now, one thing it doesn't show is a security clearance.
(1:43:31)</p><p>It doesn't show he had a security clearance. So maybe they just brought him out there to set something up for him. I don't know.
He's dead. So we can't talk to him about it. But he was out there in that short period of time.
I can't handle this. I can't handle this too much.
I couldn't handle it when I saw it.
(1:43:53)</p><p>I thought, well, it can't be the same Art Bell. And then I started looking and, you know, date of birth and stuff all matched his.
Okay. Oh, man, I've got a hundred million. Okay. We've got to get off on the subject because I want to get back to misinformation and disinformation. I feel like I am... I feel like a tool now.
(1:44:20)</p><p>You're feeding me this stuff. You're spreading it. Rick, you're spreading it right now. Wow. Really? I mean, Bob Lazar, that's hard enough to swallow.
I mean, only because he hasn't had anything, right? Everything has been completely circumstantial. But if this is the case, and this has got a document number on it, and, you know, you've researched the provenance and to make sure that it was what it is, but to have Bob Lazar's name on it, you know, the UFO community is... I've already posted it in Twitter, you know, and we'll see how this goes. Okay. Let's swing this back around though.

<p>Project Serpo とは Richard Doty（＋ Hal Puthoff）が創作し公開（2005）した AFOSI＋ CIA 謹製のヨタ話で、アメリカ人のエリート・チームが ET の母星へが UFO に同乗して訪問して…というオハナシ。SF 映画、"Close Encounters of the Third Kind"(1977) の最終シーンの続編的内容。</p>
<p>Bill Ryan も Project Serpo 専用の Web サイトを構築して情報工作に加担した。詳細は下の過去記事で取り上げた。</p>
<p><a href="http://news21c.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-18392.html" target="_blank">【編】John Greenewald : "Project SERPO" の捏造に Richard Doty とともに Hal Puthoff と Kit Green  が関与した形跡がコレだ。 （＋追加）</a> (2021-09-09)</p>
<p>この Project Serpo について Richard Doty が苦しげに捏造を認めている（が、全てが捏造ではなく少量の真実も含まれているのだと言い逃れしている）。</p>
<p>この件のような微妙なニュアンスに富んだ会話では DeepL の和訳は顕著に 稚拙/不出来 となるので、動画の該当箇所を聴くべき。</p>

<p>JC: セルポ 誤報だ 偽情報だ 政府のキャンペーンだ 何だったんだ？</p>
<hr>
<p>RD: それは...</p>
<hr>
<p>JC: イエスかノーで答えろ</p>
<hr>
<p>RD:
両方だ</p>
<p>この話は... 複雑な話なんだ。
ビクター・マルティネス、ジョー・イェーガー、そして...。(2:37:28)そして、その選手たちの名前を挙げればきりがない。
(2:37:28)</p>
<p>それから私は、他の人たちから情報を得たり供給したりしていた。
もちろん、当時はまだ僕はいなかった。私は子供だった。
でも、そのことを誓う人もいる。
そして、ロシアを怖がらせるための偽情報キャンペーンだったと言う人もいる。私たちが地球外生命体と接触したとロシア人に思わせ、ロシア人を怖がらせたかったのです。それは事実だと思う。私たちはロシア人に知らせたと思う。
(2:38:18)</p>
<p>しかし一方で、起こったことを検証できることもたくさんある。
残念なことに、彼らは死んでしまった。
でも、それが起こったことを心から語った人がいる。
何人行ったのか、12人だったのか、3人だったのか、1人だったのか、論争があるけれどね。
リンダ・ハウエルがセルポについて、あるいは彼女が知っていることについて、そして行ったとされる1人の人物について、何度も話していたことは知っている。
(2:39:01)</p>
<p>そして戻ってきた。だから、ほとんど防諜活動であるバケツの中に、ちょっとした事実があるのだと思う。</p>
<hr>
<p>GC:
なぜ彼らは、失礼ですが、このようなことでロシアを欺こうとしたのでしょうか。ロシアに、私たちがセルポという惑星に人材を派遣し、交換していると信じさせたのでしょうか。
つまり、ロシア人がそんな話を信じて何の得があるというのか？
(2:39:47)</p>
<hr>
<p>RD:
まあ、それには様々な側面がある。
第一に、もし我々が地球外生命体と接触したとロシア人が信じるなら、それは地球外生命体が我々に高度な武器や高度な研究技術を提供している可能性があることを意味する。そうなればロシアは怖がるだろう。第一に、我々は武器システムや宇宙旅行に関して、彼らが持っていないものを持っていると考えるだろう。
(2:40:24)</p>
<p>そして60年代のロシアは、スパイを意味する人的情報に関していくらか優位に立っていた。我々は開かれた社会を持っていた。彼らはそうではなかった。彼らにとって自国民を追跡するのは簡単だった。我々にとっては、スパイを把握するのは容易ではなかった。
諜報活動のコースでは、歴史を学ぶんだ。
(2:41:01)</p>
<p>私たちが学んだことの一つは、50年代から60年代にかけて、ソビエトは私たちのスパイを追跡するのが簡単だったということです。そして我々は、ソ連のスパイを追跡するのは難しい仕事だった。だから、私たちはあなたたちが持っていないものを持っているんだ、ということにつながったんだと思う。それも作戦の一部だと思う。事実はわからないけれどね。CIRPLがアメリカの諜報機関にとって何か意味があるのは知っている。
(2:41:44)</p>
<p>CIRPLという言葉は、特別な地球外惑星か何かと関係がある。CIRPLには実際の意味があり、それは少し前にここで明らかになったばかりだ。誰かが僕の知らないことを教えてくれたんだ。つまり、CIRPL文書の情報公開は可能だと？うーん 試した人はいる。DIAがビル・ライアンに公開した ドキュメントがあります 彼は... 管理者です。それはCIRPLに関する情報を持っていたが、かなり編集されていた。
(2:42:36)</p>
<p>実際には、それはCIRPLに関するものではなく、プロジェクト・クリスタル・ナイトに関するものでした。覚えています。CIRPLとは何の関係もなかった。その文書はクリスタルナイトに関するもので、国家安全保障局によって運営されていた宇宙計画でした。でも、その文書はかなり墨消しされていたから、そこから多くのことを読み取ることはできなかった。
(2:43:09)</p>
<hr>
<p>CIRPLの話から私が得た唯一のものは、ビル・ライアンのものでした。彼はそれを私に見せ、他の人にも見せて、私が行間を読めるかどうか知りたがった。でも、あまりに冗長で、何が書いてあるのかわからないんだ。
(2:43:39)</p>
<p>（途中スキップ）<br>

<p>JC:
そしてブルーブックとセルポ、確かにインターネット版のセルポとマルティネス、そして何が起こっていたのか、そしてすべてのプレーヤーたち、名前のリストや鳥小屋やその他もろもろのことには触れたくない。しかし、それは非常に集中的で包括的なキャンペーンだった。現実ではなかった。そして、もしかしたら本物かもしれない要素もあったが、それは誤った情報だった。
(2:47:39)</p>
<p>インターネットで一般大衆に直接流された偽情報だった。そして、私はその渦中にいた。リック、私はまさにそこにいた。毎日毎日、最新情報を読んでいた。（あんたが＝Dotyが）マルティネスにもっと情報を提供してくれるのを待ちきれなかったよ。</p>
<hr>
<p>RD:
わかったよ。そうだな、俺にもそんな気概があればよかったんだが。
(2:48:00)</p>
<p>僕は今頃億万長者だ。SF小説でも書いてるさ。誰が書いたんだ？</p>
<hr>
<p>JC:
その通りだ。その通りだ。最高のSFだった。とてもクリエイティブな作家が何人もいた。リック・ドティもその一人だ。</p>
<details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary>▼文字起こし 原文 展開</summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><p>Serpo. Misinformation, disinformation, government-funded campaign. What was it?
Well... It's a yes or no question, Rick. A little bit of both, I guess.
You know, that's a story and it's... I mean, that's a complex story.
If you go back and look at all the different players involved in this, Victor Martinez and Joe Yeager and... I mean, you know, I could name them forever.
(2:37:28)</p><p>And then me, I was feeding information off or getting information off other people.
Obviously, I wasn't around back in those days. I was a kid.
But there's some people that will swear by it.
And then there's some people will say, no, it was a disinformation campaign to scare the Russians. We wanted the Russians to think that we had contact with an extraterrestrial race and that would scare the Russians. Now, I think part of that's true. I think we did let the Russians know.
(2:38:18)</p><p>But on the other hand, there's a lot of things that can be verified that happened.
And there are people out there, unfortunately, they died, they're dead.
But there was one person out there who spoke from the heart about it happening.
Although there's a controversy about how many people went, whether it were 12 or three or one.
I know Linda Howell spoke many times about the Serpo or about what she knew and about the one person that she had contact with who had supposedly went.
(2:39:01)</p><p>And it came back. So I think there's a little bit of facts in a bucket that's mostly a counterintelligence operation.
Why would they try to mislead, excuse me, mislead the Russians in something like this and having the Russians believe that we were sending and trading personnel with a planet called Serpo?
I mean, what's to gain with the Russians believing a story like that?
(2:39:47)</p><p>Well, there's a number of different facets to that.
Number one, if the Russians were to believe that we had contact with an extraterrestrial race, that would mean that the extraterrestrial race could be providing us with advanced weapons or advanced research technology. And that would scare the Russians, number one, thinking that we had something they didn't have as far as a weapons system goes or even space travel.
(2:40:24)</p><p>And the Russians back in the 60s had somewhat of an advantage on human intelligence, a human meaning spies. We had an open society. They didn't. It was easy for them to keep track of their people. It was not easy for us to keep track of our people.
I know in an intelligence operations course, we learn history.
(2:41:01)</p><p>And one of the things we learned was that from the 50s on through the 60s, the Soviets had an easy job of keeping track of our spies. And we had a difficult job of keeping track of their spies. So I think that all played into this thing that, hey, we got something that you don't have. And I think that's part of the operation. Although I don't know for a fact. I know CIRPL means something to U.S. intelligence.
(2:41:44)</p><p>The word CIRPL, it's something to do with special extraterrestrial planet or something. There's an actual meaning of CIRPL, which just came out here a little while ago. Somebody brought it to my attention that I didn't know about. So... So you're suggesting it would be possible to FOIA CIRPL documents? Hmm. You know, people have tried. I know there is one document that DIA released to Bill Ryan, who he was one of the... Administrators. Administrator that had information about CIRPL, but it was heavily redacted.
(2:42:36)</p><p>Actually, it was not about CIRPL, it was about Project Crystal Night, because that was the project. I remember. It had nothing to do with CIRPL. The document pertained to Crystal Night, and it was a space program being run by the National Security Agency. And but the document was really heavily redacted, so you couldn't really make a whole lot out of it.
(2:43:09)</p><hr><p>So that's the only thing that I can remember anybody getting from the CIRPL story was Bill Ryan's. And he showed that to me, showed it to other people and wanted to know if I could, you know, maybe read between the lines, but it was too heavily redacted. I just don't know what it was about.
(2:43:39)</p><p>...skip...<br>
...skip...<br>
...skip...<br>
...skip...<br></p><p>And Blue Book and Serpo, certainly, the internet version of Serpo and Martinez and what was going on and all of the players, I don't want to get into the list of names and the aviary and all of that. But it was it was a very concentrated, comprehensive campaign that was in play. It wasn't real. And elements of it possibly being real, but it was misinformation.
(2:47:39)</p><p>It was disinformation direct right to the public on the internet. And, and I was I was in the middle of it. Rick, I was right there, man. I was reading those updates every single day. I couldn't wait for you to give some more information to Martinez. Okay. Okay. So, you know what I wish I wish I had the mind to do that.
(2:48:00)</p><p>I'd be a millionaire now. I'd be writing science fiction books. Whoever wrote that stuff. That's right. Now you just hit the nail on the head. It was some of the best science fiction ever. Some very creative writers were behind that for sure. Rick Doty being one.</p></div></div></details>

<p>タイトルの件については Linda による説明や、Doty による（別のインタビューでの）説明を含めて過去記事で何度か取り上げたが、今回の状況説明が最も詳しい。</p>
<p>Dody は Linda に実質的な買収を持ちかけたことも語っている<sup><a href="https://ouchaku.github.io/ds/blog/2024/10/17/doty_tell_he_tricked_linda#user-content-fn-1-f7c3ff" id="user-content-fnref-1-f7c3ff" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup>。2022-09-14 の収録動画。</p>

<p>そして、リンダ・ハウエルのような、とても頭のいい人を相手にすることもある。そうですね。その話をしようと思ってたんだ。これから話すことを知らない人も多いだろう。だから、簡単に概要を説明するつもりだ。それと、明かさなければならないことがある。
このことについてはリンダと個人的にじっくり話した。
(0:52:33)</p>
<p>リックとはこの件について個人的にじっくり話した。両方の言い分を聞いた。私は90％は完全に連動していると言うつもりだ。なるほど。わかった。リンダはカークランドに招待され 約束された HBOのドキュメンタリーの プレプロダクションの最中だった HBOはホワイトハウスと大統領を巻き込みたかったんだと思う。
(0:53:09)</p>
<p>そんなこんなで、彼女はカークランドに招待された。彼女はいくつかの書類を提示され、あなたのオフィスに入った。あなたは鏡を持っていて、ビデオを撮っていた。彼女は自分の上にカメラがあるのを見たと思う。彼女は部屋にカメラがあると言ったと思います。</p>
<p>(0:53:38)</p>
<p>そうです。ええと、これが要約です。では、そのドキュメントの内容に戻りましょう。事実と偽情報、そして実のところ、偽情報と誤報、2つの異なる定義がありました。リンダにこれらの文書を見せた目的は何ですか？情報源を見つけるためですか？</p>
<p>(0:54:13)</p>
<p>私たちは彼女の情報源を見つける必要がありました。私たちは知っていました。つまり、この作戦には他の機関も関わっていたんです。彼女がここに来ることは知っていましたし、どうしてこんなことを知っていたのか、詳しくは書きませんが、彼女が何をしているのかは知っていました。
(0:54:40)</p>
<p>わかりました。彼女がどこへ行くかも知っていた。誰と話しているのかも大体わかっていた。彼女がアルバカーキに来ることも知っていた。それで彼女は、私と一緒に働いていたジェリー・ミラーを通じて、私から基地に招待された。彼女と話して、彼女のUB、HBOスペシャルに役立つものを見せようと思ったんだ。
(0:55:05)</p>
<p>それで、彼女は基地に出てきて、あなたが言ったように、彼女は部屋に入って、鏡を作るために、反対側には彼女を撮影している捜査官がいました。それに室内にもカメラがあった。そこにマイクもあった。彼女は私たちが撮影していることを完全に認識していた。</p>
<p>(0:55:30)</p>
<p>彼女が言うには、上を見上げるとドアの上にカメラがあり、彼女は部屋の真ん中に座っていたそうです。あなたの机は端にありましたね？ええ。彼女は私にそう言ったんだ。椅子の位置がぎこちないと言っていました。そうでしょ？
(0:55:43)</p>
<hr>
<p>彼女を右前に座らせなければならなかった。とにかく、その前日、この書類は、軍隊の宅急便のポーチで届いたんだ。本部から極秘だと聞いていた。そして、この作戦は彼女にこの書類を見せることだと言われた。
彼女はメモを取ることも、何も保管することもできなかった。
(0:56:17)</p>
<p>彼女は何も写真を撮ることができなかった。だから私は、彼女に見せる前にそれを読む機会があった。今、私は真ん中の男です。
本部が何を知っているかは知らなかった。私は、こうするように言われた。そして、言われた通りにした。彼女に渡した。彼女はそれを読んだ。
(0:56:41)</p>
<p>彼女はそれについて私に質問し始めた。答えられる質問もあれば、答えられない質問もあった。私たちが期待していたのは、これらの文書を読んだ後、そこに書かれている情報の一部は正確であることはわかったが、多くの情報は正確ではなかった。というのも、彼女には政府内に2人の情報源があり、その情報源は機密情報だったからです。
(0:57:17)</p>
<p>だから、その人たちが誰なのか知りたかった。それがリンダ・ハウエルに対する我々の作戦の基礎だった。それを彼女に見せた後、私はこう言ったんです。彼女は、そうだね、友達は多いに越したことはないって言ったんだ。
(0:57:43)</p>
<p>それで、私はこのことを掘り下げようと、彼女との友情を保ち続けた。ワシントンD.C.で会ったこともあるし、ニューヨークで会ったこともある。まず、リンダ・ハウエルはとても素晴らしい人だった。
彼女は私がやろうとしていることを知っていて、それに乗ろうとはしなかった。
実際、私たちはジョージタウンのカフェで昼食をとりながら、彼女に売り込んだんだ。
(0:58:19)</p>
<p>聞いてほしいのは、僕らのために働いてほしいんだ。給料は払う。あなたが知っていることを教えてください。彼女はただそこに座って、しばらく私の話を聞いていた。彼女は手ごわい人だった。とにかく、彼女とはしばらく連絡を取り合ったが、その後、別の捜査官がその作戦に関わることになった。
(0:58:59)</p>
<p>でも、そういう経緯だった。というのも、HBOのスペシャル番組が、私たちが望まない、政府が望まない、米国諜報機関が望まないものを放送しようとしていたからです。それを終わらせることができた。我々の任務の一部は成功した。
ここで休憩に入ろう。
(0:59:26)</p>
<details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary>▼文字起こし 原文 展開</summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><p>And, um, and then, and then you have, you have people that are very smart that you're dealing with such as Linda Howell. I mean, okay. I was going to bring that up. Okay. So, uh, many may not know what we're about to talk about. So I'm just going to give a brief summary. Um, and, uh, I've got to disclose.
I've spoken to Linda at length about this privately.
(0:52:33)</p><p>I've spoken to Rick about this at length privately. I've gotten both sides of the story. I'm going to say that 90% of it completely interlocks. Okay. All right. And so, uh, basically, uh, Linda was invited out to Kirkland and was promised, uh, she was in the middle of this HBO documentary that, uh, was in the works and it was in pre-production. Um, there was some, uh, the white house was, uh, she was trying to get I think that HBO wanted the white house involved and the president involved.
(0:53:09)</p><p>And so with all of this, she's invited out to Kirkland. She is going to be presented some documents and she, uh, goes into your office. Um, you had a mirror, you were videotaping. I think she even saw a camera above her. I think she said that there was a camera in the room. Um, and you told her that she could read the documents, but she couldn't take them with her.
(0:53:38)</p><p>Right now. Um, so that's, that's the summary of it. Now let's go back to, uh, the contents of those documents. Was some of it facts, uh, with disinformation and as a matter of fact, disinformation, misinformation, two different definitions. Um, we'll circle back to that for some clarification, but, uh, what was the purpose of showing Linda these docs? Uh, was it to find her sources? Uh, was it, was there something else involved there that had nothing to do with UFOs?
(0:54:13)</p><p>We needed to find her sources. We knew, uh, I got involved in this late. I mean, there were other agencies involved in this operation. Um, we knew that she was coming to, uh, and I'm not going to go into great details of how we knew all this stuff, but we knew what she was doing.
(0:54:40)</p><p>Okay. We knew where she was going. We knew who she was talking to for the most part. And we knew she was coming to Albuquerque. And so she was invited by me, uh, through, uh, Jerry Miller, um, who worked with me to the base. And I was going to talk to her and show her something, uh, that would help her in her, with her UB, uh, HBO special.
(0:55:05)</p><p>So, so she came out to the base and like you said, she was in a room, uh, to make way mirror, there were agents on the other side filming her. Plus it was a camera inside. We had a microphone in there too. She was fully aware that we were filming. I know at one point years ago, she said she didn't, but she's smart.
(0:55:30)</p><p>She told me, she looked up and saw a camera like above the door and she was sitting in the middle of the room. Your desk was on one end, right? Okay. Yeah. That's the way that she presented that with me. And she said that the chair was awkwardly placed. Right?
(0:55:43)</p><hr><p>We had to get her right in front of the right. Anyways, uh, now the day before these documents came in through a pouch, uh, armed forces courier pouch. So I knew they were top secret from headquarters now. Uh, and I was told the pro the, the, the operation was to show her these documents.
She couldn't take any notes and she couldn't keep anything.
(0:56:17)</p><p>She couldn't take any photographs of anything. So I had a chance prior to showing them to her to read them. Now I'm the middle guy.
Now I'm not, you got to understand that I didn't know what headquarters knew. I was, this is what I was told to do. And I did what I was told to do. I gave them to her. She read them.
(0:56:41)</p><p>She started asking me questions about them. Some of the questions I could answer, some of them I couldn't. Now, what we were hoping that after reading these documents, which I know that some of the information in there was accurate, but a lot of the information in there wasn't accurate. What we were hoping was she'd come around to our side because she had two sources within the government that was providing her information that was of classified, it was classified information.
(0:57:17)</p><p>So we wanted to know who those people were. And that was the basis of our operation against Linda Howell. So after I showed her those, I said to her, listen, I'd like to get to know you, like know what you're doing as far as programming and so forth. And she said, sure, you know, you can never have too many friends.
(0:57:43)</p><p>So I kept a friendship with her trying to delve into this. I've met her in Washington, D.C. I've met her in New York City, trying to find these people. Well, first of all, Linda Howell, very brilliant person.
And she knew what I was trying to do and she wasn't going to run with it.
In fact, we were having we were in Georgetown at a cafe having lunch and I pitched her.
(0:58:19)</p><p>I did the pitching by saying, listen, what I want you to do is work for us. We'll pay you. You just tell me what you know. And she just sat there and listened to me for some time and she said, not no, but hell no, in a polite way. She was a tough cookie to crack. Anyways, I maintained contact with her for some time and then another agent became involved with that operation.
(0:58:59)</p><p>But that's that's how it went. And we actually accomplished one of the was to end the HBO special because they were going to air something that we didn't want, that the government didn't want, U.S. intelligence didn't want. And we were able to end that. And so part of our mission was successful.
Let's take our break right here.

<p>休憩に入る前に話を戻してもいいですか？リンダのHBOのドキュメンタリーに空軍が載せたくないものがあると言っていましたね。それは何ですか？
(1:27:14)</p>
<hr>
<p>それは、1974年にホロマン空軍基地に着陸する前に起こった事件について彼女が話していたことでした。ケビン・エッガーは彼女にフィルムを見せるつもりだったらしい。リンダは政府が誰にも見せたくないものにアクセスしていた。まだ機密扱いだった。それをHBOが持っていた。そしてHBOはそれを諜報関係者に引き渡したんだ。
(1:27:49)</p>
<p>HBOは何を持っていたのですか？フィルムを持っていたのか？
実はオリジナルのフィルムを持っていたんだ。
本当に？
ええ。その一部が流出したんだ。つまり、15秒の50秒だったかな。
ええ、ええ、私たちはみんなそれを見たわ。でも、実際のところは......つまり、数分なんだ。33分だった。
UFO学の聖杯だ。
(1:28:18)</p>
<p>私は何人かの人と話をしました。1人はコピーを見た人、もう1人は実物を見た人、今、Mとエッガーのプロジェクトに関わったプロデューサーやその他に話を聞きました。でもそれは聖杯でしょう？オリジナルのフィルムはどこにあるんですか？
ああ、それは......見たよ。まあ、33分は見てないけど。
もちろん、15秒のものは見たよ。
(1:28:44)</p>
<p>それから、7分7分だったかな。正確な長さは覚えていない。10分もなかった。確か7秒か7分だったと思う。
つまり、着陸するところと、宇宙船から出てくる生き物を映していたんだ。
軍関係者との面会は映っていないけど、それ以外の26分間にそれについて話した人たちがいるからね。
(1:29:17)</p>
<p>つまり、ハル・プソフにはその一部始終を見た友人がいて、異常だと思ったし、1964年の事件だから政府が作ったものではないと知っていた。それで政府は望みをかなえた。つまり、作戦は成功した。彼らはそれを取り戻した。
リンダはどうしたんだ？リンダとは話したことがない。彼女は見たのか？
(1:29:44)</p>
<p>分からない。彼女に聞いてみないと。
ホロマンフィルムを見たHBOの幹部は、UFO学以外の一般人がこれを見たのですか？まあ、私が言えることは、彼らが持っていることを知っていたということです。誰が見たかは知りませんが、私は知っていましたし、それは私の作戦ではありませんでした。ニューヨークとワシントンで働いていた諜報員たちだ。だから私は、彼らがそこでやっていたことのすべてにアクセスすることはできなかった。
(1:30:21)</p>
<details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary>▼文字起こし 原文 展開</summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><p>Can I circle back real quick before we get to the break? You mentioned that there was something that was supposed to be in Linda's HBO documentary that the Air Force didn't want in there. What was that?
(1:27:14)</p><hr><p>It was the it was she was talking about an incident that happened prior to the 1974 landing at Holloman Air Force Base. Kevin Egger supposedly was going to gave her saw the film. Linda had access to something that the government didn't want anybody to see. It was still classified. HBO had it. And then HBO turned it over to some of our intelligence people.
(1:27:49)</p><p>What did HBO have? Did they have film or did they have?
They actually had the original film.
Really?
Yeah. And some of it has leaked out. I mean, that there's there's a 15 second 50, I believe it was 15 seconds.
Yeah, yeah, we've all seen that. But the actual real I mean, that's the minutes. It was 33 minutes.
Yeah, that's the Holy Grail of ufology.
(1:28:18)</p><p>I've talked to a couple of people that one that saw a copy of another one that saw the actual now talk to the producers and and and stuff that were involved in M and Eggers project. But that's the Holy Grail, right? Where is the original film?
Yeah, that's I mean, I've seen it. Well, I haven't seen the 33 minutes.
I saw that, of course, a 15 second one you can look at.
(1:28:44)</p><p>And then I saw the I think it was seven seven minutes or something. I can't remember exactly how long it was. It was less than 10 minutes. I believe it was seven seconds, seven minutes, which was extraordinary.
I mean, it showed the landing and showed the creatures coming out of the spaceship.
That doesn't show the meeting with the military people, but because that's on the other the rest of the 26 minutes that there's people that talked about it.
(1:29:17)</p><p>I mean, I know that Hal Puthoff had a friend that saw the whole thing and thought it was extraordinary and knew it wasn't made by the government because it was, you know, a 1964 incident. And so the government got what they wanted. I mean, the operation was successful. They got it back.
And what did Linda? I've never talked to Linda about this. Did she see it?
(1:29:44)</p><p>I'm not sure. You'd have to ask her.
Executives at HBO that saw the Holloman film that there are civilians out there outside of ufology that have seen this? Well, all I can say is I knew they had it. I don't know if you know who saw it, but I knew and that wasn't my operation. It was the agents that were working in New York area and Washington. So I didn't have access to everything that they were doing there, but they got the film back.

<li>2:38:00 Project Serpo について。事実が含まれいてるはずだ。</li>
</ul>
<p>セルポ 誤報だ 偽情報だ 政府のキャンペーンだ 何だったんだ？</p>
<hr>
<p>それは...</p>
<hr>
<p>イエスかノーで答えろ 両方だ</p>
<hr>
<p>この話は... 複雑な話なんだ。
ビクター・マルティネス、ジョー・イェーガー、そして...。(2:37:28)そして、その選手たちの名前を挙げればきりがない。
(2:37:28)</p>
<p>それから私は、他の人たちから情報を得たり供給したりしていた。
もちろん、当時はまだ僕はいなかった。私は子供だった。
でも、そのことを誓う人もいる。
そして、ロシアを怖がらせるための偽情報キャンペーンだったと言う人もいる。私たちが地球外生命体と接触したとロシア人に思わせ、ロシア人を怖がらせたかったのです。それは事実だと思う。私たちはロシア人に知らせたと思う。
(2:38:18)</p>
<p>しかし一方で、起こったことを検証できることもたくさんある。
残念なことに、彼らは死んでしまった。
でも、それが起こったことを心から語った人がいる。
何人行ったのか、12人だったのか、3人だったのか、1人だったのか、論争があるけれどね。
リンダ・ハウエルがセルポについて、あるいは彼女が知っていることについて、そして行ったとされる1人の人物について、何度も話していたことは知っている。
(2:39:01)</p>
<p>そして戻ってきた。だから、ほとんど防諜活動であるバケツの中に、ちょっとした事実があるのだと思う。
なぜ彼らは、失礼ですが、このようなことでロシアを欺こうとしたのでしょうか。ロシアに、私たちがセルポという惑星に人材を派遣し、交換していると信じさせたのでしょうか。
つまり、ロシア人がそんな話を信じて何の得があるというのか？
(2:39:47)</p>
<p>まあ、それには様々な側面がある。
第一に、もし我々が地球外生命体と接触したとロシア人が信じるなら、それは地球外生命体が我々に高度な武器や高度な研究技術を提供している可能性があることを意味する。そうなればロシアは怖がるだろう。第一に、我々は武器システムや宇宙旅行に関して、彼らが持っていないものを持っていると考えるだろう。
(2:40:24)</p>
<p>そして60年代のロシアは、スパイを意味する人的情報に関していくらか優位に立っていた。我々は開かれた社会を持っていた。彼らはそうではなかった。彼らにとって自国民を追跡するのは簡単だった。我々にとっては、スパイを把握するのは容易ではなかった。
諜報活動のコースでは、歴史を学ぶんだ。
(2:41:01)</p>
<p>私たちが学んだことの一つは、50年代から60年代にかけて、ソビエトは私たちのスパイを追跡するのが簡単だったということです。そして我々は、ソ連のスパイを追跡するのは難しい仕事だった。だから、私たちはあなたたちが持っていないものを持っているんだ、ということにつながったんだと思う。それも作戦の一部だと思う。事実はわからないけれどね。CIRPLがアメリカの諜報機関にとって何か意味があるのは知っている。
(2:41:44)</p>
<p>CIRPLという言葉は、特別な地球外惑星か何かと関係がある。CIRPLには実際の意味があり、それは少し前にここで明らかになったばかりだ。誰かが僕の知らないことを教えてくれたんだ。つまり、CIRPL文書の情報公開は可能だと？うーん 試した人はいる。DIAがビル・ライアンに公開した ドキュメントがあります 彼は... 管理者です。それはCIRPLに関する情報を持っていたが、かなり編集されていた。
(2:42:36)</p>
<p>実際には、それはCIRPLに関するものではなく、プロジェクト・クリスタル・ナイトに関するものでした。覚えています。CIRPLとは何の関係もなかった。その文書はクリスタルナイトに関するもので、国家安全保障局によって運営されていた宇宙計画でした。でも、その文書はかなり墨消しされていたから、そこから多くのことを読み取ることはできなかった。
(2:43:09)</p>
<hr>
<p>CIRPLの話から私が得た唯一のものは、ビル・ライアンのものでした。彼はそれを私に見せ、他の人にも見せて、私が行間を読めるかどうか知りたがった。でも、あまりに冗長で、何が書いてあるのかわからないんだ。
(2:43:39)</p>
<p>さて、番組の冒頭で、プロジェクト・ブルーブックは正真正銘の偽情報、誤報キャンペーンであると述べました。私は、歴史はこのままその道を進んでいくと思います。あなたにとって、UFOに関して空軍がアメリカ国民に直接誤った情報を流した最高の証拠ですか？
ああ、そうだね、最初はプログラムだったと思う。
(2:44:12)</p>
<p>怨恨』から『ブルーブック』に名前が変わったのは、異なる目的を持った異なる管理者がいたからだ。私の叔父、エドワード・ドティがプロジェクト・ブルーブックに関わっていたことは知っている。彼は調査官だった。彼は、なぜ名前を変えたのか、また、空に浮かぶものは何なのかという疑問に対する答えがすぐにわかるような公開捜査と、答えが出せない、答えのない、よりミステリアスな事件との違いや、その分類方法について話してくれました。
(2:45:10)</p>
<p>あなたが言ったように、これは一種の偽情報キャンペーンなのです。なぜなら、政府が話した中で、正当な地球外生命体や地球外生命体との接触であると特定されたケースは一つもなかったからです。
これらのケースは機密扱いだった。極秘扱いだったのだ。そして、他の誰かに調査を依頼した。現地調査員は、既知の天体のケースのみを調査した。率直に言って、人々が見ていたもののほとんどは、飛行機、研究開発用飛行機、あるいは金星、惑星ビーナス、その他のものとして簡単に識別できた。
(2:46:15)</p>
<p>しかし、そうでないものは、政府が公の場に出てきて、「この700件、701件、701件が特定できない。そして、あらゆる兆候からして、それらは地球外生命体である。内々ではそう言っているが、機密文書ではそう言っている。
(2:46:41)</p>
<p>しかし、彼らはそれを公表するつもりはない。私たちは皆、そのことを理解していると思います。でも、私が言いたいのは、ありがとうございます。私が言いたいのは、誤報や偽情報について話すとき、これらは直接的なものだということです。つまり、自分で調べたり、フォローアップしたりできることなのです。
(2:47:12)</p>
<p>そしてブルーブックとセルポ、確かにインターネット版のセルポとマルティネス、そして何が起こっていたのか、そしてすべてのプレーヤーたち、名前のリストや鳥小屋やその他もろもろのことには触れたくない。しかし、それは非常に集中的で包括的なキャンペーンだった。現実ではなかった。そして、もしかしたら本物かもしれない要素もあったが、それは誤った情報だった。
(2:47:39)</p>
<p>インターネットで一般大衆に直接流された偽情報だった。そして、私はその渦中にいた。リック、私はまさにそこにいた。毎日毎日、最新情報を読んでいた。マルティネスにもっと情報を提供してくれるのを待ちきれなかったよ。わかったよ。そうだな、俺にもそんな気概があればよかったんだが。
(2:48:00)</p>
<p>僕は今頃億万長者だ。SF小説でも書いてるさ。誰が書いたんだ？その通りだ。その通りだ。最高のSFだった。とてもクリエイティブな作家が何人もいた。リック・ドティもその一人だ。では、MJ-12について話しましょう。繰り返しになりますが、あなたの意見では、私はすでに述べましたが、ワシントンD.C.からの誤報、偽情報キャンペーンですか？ええ、これらの文書はDIA内の特別手段委員会で作成されたものです。情報の中には合法的なものもある。
(2:48:50)</p>
<p>つまり、名前や日付、場所を確認することはできるし、誰がどこにいたかを調べることもできる。でも、その大部分は偽情報だったと言えると思います。
(2:49:25)</p>
<p>わかった、わかった。誰がそれを手に入れたのかを理解しなければならない。

<p>The smoke radio for the masses.
Headline edition, July 8th, 1947. The Army Air Forces has announced that a flying disc has been found and is now in the possession of the Army. Would the gaming rig change the game?
Game changer.
I occasionally think how quickly our differences worldwide would vanish if we were facing an alien threat from outside this world.

Crazy breaking news right before the show tonight.
Amtrak. That's right.
Amtrak in the news.
All long-distance Amtrak trains are canceled starting tomorrow, Thursday, September 15th. Negotiations are ongoing between unions and railroad companies, although Amtrak isn't part of that.
(0:12:11)</p>
<p>If they don't come to an agreement, the first national rail strike in 30 years could kick off early on Friday. So there you go.
I know you had all those plans, right?
(0:12:25)</p>
<hr>
<p>The Orient Express. I know you had that planned.
It's not in the United States. All right.
Ukrainian President Zelensky right before showtime tonight got in a car accident, but he emerged with no serious injuries.
The car collision was in Kiev right before showtime tonight.
According to a statement from the president's press secretary, a car collided with the car of the president of Ukraine and escort vehicles.
(0:12:57)</p>
<p>Strange, right?
Authorities are investigating the circumstances of the incident, and there is no more information at this time.
I'll follow up with everything tomorrow on the show.
But it seems a little bit funky because another top ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin has died today, this time of an alleged stroke, while on a business trip in the village of Rushino in Russia's Far East region.
(0:13:34)</p>
<p>Vladimir Sungorkin, 68 years old, was the editor-in-chief of the Russian state newspaper Pravda. According to the newspaper, Sungorkin died suddenly after showing signs of suffocation during his trip earlier today.
Man, I'm not gonna comment on this.
I don't know what the solution is.
But I mean, don't take a trip to Eastern Russia. That's top on the list.
Whoever you... Don't go to East Russia. Bad things happen.
(0:14:10)</p>
<p>Germany and Japan have pledged not to conduct destructive anti-satellite tests that could create dangerous clouds of space debris in orbit.
The announcement of these pledges were made at the second session of the United Nations on reducing space threats, which is being held in Geneva to reduce those threats in space.
Germany and Japan's announcement follows similar pledges made by the United States, Canada, and New Zealand. There you go.
(0:14:45)</p>
<p>Threat in space.
Yeah, we saw this coming.
Let's get this show cracking.
On this day in history, 1959, another threat in space.
1959, a Soviet rocket carrying the flag of the Soviet Union crashes into the moon, becoming the first man-made object sent from Earth to reach the lunar surface.
That's how they got there.
Couldn't land it.
It just crashed it with the Soviet flag.
(0:15:20)</p>
<ol start="1959">
<li>That's a threat in space.
Fader fact.
All right, here you go.
And the clock starts now.
In the time it took for you to listen to me say that, around 100,000 cells in your body died and were replaced by new ones.
Yeah, that's pretty cool.
And that is your fader fact.
You know, I just finished The White Lotus. Have you guys seen that yet?
(0:16:00)</li>
</ol>
<p>Have you guys watched The White Lotus?
It's on HBO. HBO Max. HBO. The White Lotus. Go and check it out.
All right, it's not what you think.
The White Lotus is a resort in Hawaii. So it's a series, six episodes.
Jennifer Coolidge. They need the small trains so they can make the big trains.
I love Jennifer Coolidge. She's amazing.
And she's amazing in this.
(0:16:30)</p>
<p>I think she just won an Emmy for her performance in that.
But The White Lotus, when it came out, got past me.
(0:16:38)</p>
<hr>
<p>And I just finished my binge.
If you haven't watched The White Lotus, it just got picked up for season two.
It was only supposed to be six episodes, just one off an anthology.
So they're doing it again.
And yeah, but it's not going to be in Hawaii. I think it's going to be in Spain. Some of the stars, I don't know how they're going to do it.
(0:17:01)</p>
<p>All right, I just spoke too much.
Just check out The White Lotus. And I bring that up because... Cobra Kai. Cobra Kai. The new season is out.
Oh, man.
It's weird how I... I love science fiction so much.
And the movies.
And Thor, Love and Thunder, is out.
And I still haven't watched that.
It's sitting there.
And I'm going to get to it.
(0:17:33)</p>
<p>But I love my science fiction.
I do.
But getting away from science fiction, like Parks and Recreation, right?
Brooklyn Nine-Nine, amazing.
And Cobra Kai, you know, things like that.
I like to get off of science fiction and just get into this doofus stuff.
What was that other one?
Kimmy Schmidt Saves the World or whatever that thing was called.
Man, that was a great series.
(0:18:00)</p>
<p>I enjoyed it.
All right, let me hit this Rivermoon Coffee. Tonight, Richard Doty is back with us.
We're going to be talking about the possible disinfo, misinfo, and ufology.
I'm going to talk more about that in just a minute.
And tomorrow's another fader night with open lines all night long.
Yeah, there you go.
Thank you for that, Olivia. Jennifer Coolidge, she's amazing.
And Napoleon Dynamite. You remember Napoleon Dynamite's uncle, the quarterback from the football team, right?
(0:18:33)</p>
<p>You remember him?
I used to throw that... throw for a mile.
You remember that, right?
Okay, anyway, he's in the White Lotus. He's Jennifer Coolidge's boyfriend.
All right, spoiler alert.
Yeah, that's pretty cool.
Okay, anyway, tomorrow night is fader night with open lines all night long.
Let me hit this Rivermoon Coffee. I like my coffee, Doc. Like Rick Doty. Rick Doty likes his coffee, Doc. Rivermoon Coffee. Rivermoonwellness.com. The links are below.
(0:19:10)</p>
<p>Promo code F2BBLEND. All right, disinformation.
Misinformation. They have been part of ufology in our community for decades.
This, my friends, my family, this is a fact.
That's right.
If you want direct, serious proof, I'll start with this.
Project Blue Book. That's right.
Think about this for a second.
Because, you know, and that went on for, let's go, I'm going to round some numbers off.
(0:20:05)</p>
<p>1950 to 1960, 1960, 1970. Okay, so let's go round about 20 years of misinfo, disinfo.
Project Blue Book was written, it was designed to, and published for, spreading of disinformation directly to the public about UFOs. That's right.
Our very own government and the U.S. Air Force, all with taxpayer dollars.
Now, think about that.
And this went on in an official capacity.
And think about the amount of work that was put into Project Blue Book. Right?
(0:20:57)</p>
<p>You got J. Allen Hynek, you got his team going out investigating cases, and then publishing the results of that in a deliberate attempt to spread disinformation.
(0:21:09)</p>
<hr>
<p>Right?
Think about that.
And any of the serious cases in there, and there were 701 that were never resolved, no serious research there, no comment there, right?
And that is misinformation.
Think about that.
All right?
This went on for 20 years.
And when you want to say, well, why would they... there's a lot of reasons for it.
And I think that on top of the food chain, that if there is anything to talk about, if there's any knowledge about the UFO subject, that is something that the Air Force, the military, the Pentagon, the White House decided that we didn't need to know.
(0:22:04)</p>
<p>And that's it.
That was a subject that was going to be kept from the American public and the world.
And at the front of all of that was Project Blue Book. But that's not the only... If you want a direct example, right?
And by spreading that throughout ufology to all of the researchers that were researching the subject in the 50s and 60s that knew about Project Blue Book, think about the influence that it had on everybody else out there.
(0:22:49)</p>
<p>So there's that.
But then we can move forward.
I'll give you another example, in my opinion.
We have Project Serpo. And Project Serpo, again, I think that there is enough data and information out there to suggest to everyone that it was, once again, disinformation created by our government through any means to spread disinformation into the UFO community.
And it was very effective.
It was very effective.
(0:23:27)</p>
<p>And it was done with modern means, electronically, the internet.
So you have that.
And Project Serpo, I can't express enough that it was a situation in my life.
And I'm sure that you can go, the internet, UFO Wayback Machine, go and find the original website and certainly the latest iteration of the website with all of the updates and look at how much information was there.
(0:24:07)</p>
<p>It was crazy.
And I was coming home every day looking for another update from Martinez. Is there going to be something there?
And these updates were, you know, detailed and deep.
And we had the aviary and, oh, man, it was nuts.
But it wasn't real, right?
And I think that, and especially with the people that were involved with it, all fingers point back to Washington and different three-letter agencies.
(0:24:42)</p>
<p>So there's an example right there.
Now, why would they do it, right?
Now, I think that there were a lot of reasons for that to happen like it did.
And I think that with disinformation and misinformation and the way that it's handled and distributed throughout the UFO community, the government wants to know who's talking to who.
Who are your sources?
Who are you giving information to?
(0:25:08)</p>
<p>Is there a leak inside of the Pentagon or inside of the CIA, right?
Is there, right?
And who is communicating?
So you put these little nuggets out there and then you find out through cross-channels and communication who was talking to who.
(0:25:26)</p>
<hr>
<p>And I think Serpo did exactly that.
Exactly that.
But probably not as much as the MJ-12 document.
All right?
Now, here's the deal.
MJ-12 documents this thick.
Well, everybody involved, except for Stanton Friedman, had connections back to the Air Force and the Air Force OSI and other government agencies and, of course, the Pentagon, right?
The OSI, the Office of Special Investigations. And Rick can certainly comment further on that during the broadcast tonight.
(0:26:13)</p>
<p>But here's the deal.
When we go back and you look at Project Blue Book and you look at Serpo and others too as well, I don't have the time tonight to go through every single case of disinformation and misinformation that's been out there.
But just like Blue Book and Serpo with Stanton Friedman, you have somebody that's legitimately involved in all of these, and that adds to the credibility of what you're dealing with.
(0:26:47)</p>
<p>And having Stanton there with Jamie Shandoray, right, and Bill Moore, it added to the credibility of what MJ-12 was all about.
And Stanton went off and did his own investigation into it, and it was something that just sat there and not only spread through the UFO community, but if you think that we are in the days of disclosure today, when the MJ-12 documents came out and how they came out, we all thought that we were in disclosure, that this was it.
(0:27:28)</p>
<p>This was the document truth.
This wasn't the three grainy leaked Navy videos of UAPs. We're talking about stacks of documents that had to go and get reviewed that all appeared to be official.
Now, you need to think about that.
That was a pretty effective campaign, and it really kept everybody going in and chasing their tails in every direction.
But today, because that's 20 years ago, those were the old days.
(0:28:04)</p>
<p>Today, we have social media.
Today, we have the internet.
Of course, we have websites, and it's much easier and faster to spread the seeds that you want or need to sow, those seeds of disinformation, of misinformation, to create distrust, right, to start a feud or two, character attacks.
Yeah, it's so much easier than delivering a package to an address with a roll of film in it, you know, and you got to wait and see what's going to happen.
(0:28:36)</p>
<p>Is the package going to get open?
Is the film going to be there?
Is it going to be developed?
Is somebody going to do something with it?
You have to sit and wait.
Not today.
Oh, no.
With the net, we know action is just a click away, and you can monitor everything in real time. You can see who was talking to who, right?
(0:29:00)</p>
<p>And you know what I'm talking about because you do it every day, don't you?
Of course, you do.
When we talk about Mockingbird and the ability for agencies in Washington, D.C. to get journalists out there, newscasters, talking heads on the payroll to handle misinformation and disinformation, to handle what the public hears and sees and reads, right?
(0:29:35)</p>
<hr>
<p>Today, with the internet, you don't have to pay.
You don't have to go and recruit these journalists and these newscasters.
It's all on the internet.
Think about that.
So, is that going down in ufology today?
Yes, I think it's a fact.
It has to.
It's too easy.
And it's just not ufology, it's everything.

<p>Fade to black is not your father's radio show on the Game Changer Radio Network. Hi, this is Rob Reiner from Anvil. And you're listening to JimmyChurchRadio.com What's up?
What's up?
All right, welcome back.
Fade to black.
I am your host, Jimmy Church. I gotta stretch.
I gotta get ready.
Rick Doty's here tonight.
That's right.
We've got a lot to talk about.
Oh, I got a little short in my headphones.
(0:35:49)</p>
<p>Hold on.
Let's see if I'm back.
I'm back.
He was born in New York State, but grew up in a military family, then served his country in the United States Air Force. He was hired by the Air Force Office of Special Investigation after attending intelligence course taught by the Air Force Office of Special Investigations, Defense Intelligence Agency and the Central Intelligence Agency. He served at Kirkland Air Force Base as a counterintelligence officer.
(0:36:18)</p>
<p>He saw duty at the Nevada Test Site, the Air Force Test Center, Detachment 3, Groom Lake, Nevada. He also investigated the Coyote Canyon UFO sighting on Kirkland Air Force Base. And of course, the Paul Bennewitz incident.
He was also assigned to AFOSI European Headquarters. We spotting.
Oh, we spotting.
Really?
I didn't know that.
As a counterespionage agent, after leaving the AFOSI, he was assigned to the Air Force Reserve Unit and later was employed by the state of New Mexico. He also worked for the Institute for Advanced Studies and with Hal Puthoff. And today he's retired and employed as a consultant.
(0:37:00)</p>
<p>He's actually a movie star and is featured in GAIA TV's Cosmic Disclosure. And we've got links for Rick below.
And I would like to welcome back to Fade to Black, Rick Doty. Richard Doty. Rick Doty, how are you doing tonight, sir?
Great, Jimmy. Great to be here.
Great to be on your show.
Yeah, I love the smile, you know.
And, you know, Rick's like, okay, man, I hope this goes well.
(0:37:27)</p>
<p>But here's the thing.
Let's actually just start out of the gate.
Rick, you and I know each other.
We've had our bumps in, you know, in the road in the past.
But we've hung out.
We broke bread.
I think we've had a cocktail or two as well.
I've even introduced you.
I think, wait a minute.
Were you on one of my panels once?
(0:37:50)</p>
<p>Yes, I was.
Yeah, okay.
So we've kind of, you know, we've done everything in the past.
So just with the measure of trust, I have to ask this.
You know that there are people listening to this show right now that are going, we can't believe anything that comes out of Doty's mouth.
(0:38:15)</p>
<hr>
<p>You know, how can we trust what he says?
And this is something that you're confronted with, I'm sure, or you feel that pressure every single day.
I need your response to that.
Well, I had a job to do years ago with the Air Force Office of Special Investigations as a counterintelligence officer.
A lot of my work wasn't pleasant work.
A lot of it involved disinformation, misinformation.
(0:38:46)</p>
<p>A lot of that information has leaked or been released through FOIA over the years.
And the one thing that people hold against me is the Paul Benowitz case.
Yes. Well, and you can include me, right?
We have talked about this.
Absolutely. And the story is, I was instructed to do an operation against Paul Benowitz because of what he knew and what he was doing.
(0:39:20)</p>
<p>And I had to provide him information that wasn't totally accurate.
But if you've read the report, many people have, and listened to me, and some of the people even had talked to Paul before he passed away.
They found out the truth is, I never fed him anything that he didn't want to hear.
Paul Benowitz was already a believer in UFOs. And so it wasn't difficult for me to convince him of what we wanted him to believe.
(0:39:55)</p>
<p>And that's what they hold against me all these years.
I used to get hundreds and hundreds of emails, probably 60% of them pretty nasty ones.
But today, in 2022, I still get a lot of emails, but most of them are really positive.
I still get some negative ones.
As long as they're polite, negative, I'll answer, I'll respond to them.
But I'm not the horrible, evil person that people thought of me, and primarily because of Paul Benowitz. When people get to know me and meet me, they like me.
(0:40:40)</p>
<p>You know, they like you to sit down and talk.
I've had some... Rick, Rick, is that disinformation?
Is acting that role part of the agent's job?
Oh, absolutely.
Yeah, it is.
I mean, we're taught that.
We're taught to do that.
But I left government service, and other than Air Force Reserves, which I didn't have anything to do with UFOs, I left government services years ago, and I didn't work in that particular arena since.
(0:41:21)</p>
<p>Now, jumping to here today, there are people out there that are performing disinformation against the UFO community, and I've known him.
I know about him.
I've tried to out him.
Some people listen to me, some people don't. But we have to be really, really careful.
I mean, we... I consider myself still within the UFO community.
We have to be very careful of what people are saying now, today, about the UFO phenomena, or UAP phenomena, and how that could harm future disclosure.
(0:42:05)</p>
<p>And we're obviously going to talk about that in the show.
Let me ask you another direct question.
You retired in 2000, right?
I retired... No, from government service, I retired in 1988. Oh, okay.
(0:42:28)</p>
<hr>
<p>No, I was in the reserves.
Well, you were in the reserves in 94. Yeah, I did.
I was in the Air Force Reserves up till 94. My intelligence service ended in 88. In 88. Could you comment about what your job would have been like if you had social media in 1988?
Oh, wow.
We could have manipulated... We could have been sitting at a desk on a computer manipulating everyone we wanted to manipulate.
(0:43:11)</p>
<p>We could have been feeding so much misinformation through the social media network that it would have changed people's thinking.
Because I know that you heard my comments opening up the show.
Yes, yes.
And if we go back and think about some of the pretty monstrous, pretty huge disinfo campaigns, obviously Project Blue Book. Imagine if Project Blue Book was dealt with on social media.
(0:43:42)</p>
<p>Holy crap, right?
It would have been a totally different game.
The MJ-12 documents.
If social media would have been around... The internet was in its infancy back then, for sure.
But it would have been a different game with social media.
Project Serpo, which was on the internet, but there was no social media then.
That was a website.
So, again, its effectiveness.
But when you put an envelope in the mail, right, with a roll of film in it, that's like printing flyers to your band's concert, right?
(0:44:20)</p>
<p>You're hoping for the best, right?
And it's a slow process.
But with social media today, it's instant.
And certainly, anybody in Washington, D.C., in the game understands this.
Oh, absolutely.
You know, disinformation or misinformation or disinformation, whatever you want to call it, it's false information that tends to deceive something, deceive an operation or deceive people.
And it still goes on today.
Normally, what we... The main purpose of disinformation back in the days when I was taught, when I actually went to a classroom and taught how to spread disinformation, was to deceive the Soviet Union, deceive our enemies.
(0:45:13)</p>
<p>But you can use it in any type of operation to deceive someone.
And just think about it.
It happens all the time in industry.
One particular company is trying to deceive, trying to get up our hand on another company.
So they spread false information about another person's product.
That's disinformation.
It happens all the time.
It happens in society.
It happens in the social structure of our society, where one neighbor doesn't like another neighbor, so he spreads false information about that neighbor.
(0:45:51)</p>
<p>I mean, it's just like that.
And it's always going to happen.
It's just how well you do it.
And believe me, during my time in the late 70s up to the 80s, we were good at it.
We were very, very, very good at disinformation.
We call it counterintelligence operations to protect special access programs.
And we were very, very good at it.
And let me give you an example of what we did.
(0:46:26)</p>
<p>When I worked out at Area 51, Nellis Test and Training Range, most of that area was in Nye County. Back in those days, prostitution was legal in Nye County. So we were afraid that the people that were working on classified projects, and believe me, there were many highly classified programs and projects going on at Tonopah Air Base or Area 51 or even in Nevada Test Site. So what we did was we went out and we recruited every single prostitute in Nye County. Basically, every prostitute in that county, and even in Esmeralda County, which kind of borders it, were under our control.
(0:47:21)</p>
<p>We paid them.
(0:47:21)</p>
<hr>
<p>We paid them more than they were getting doing tricks because we were afraid that military air force, primarily air force people, would come and be serviced by them.
And believe me, that happened all the time.
We didn't want the information that they had leaking through them, through the prostitutes, out to the public.
So we owned them all.
And we made some big, major operations stopping the leak of information, classified information out of special projects, from being leaked into the public by disinformation.
(0:48:04)</p>
<p>So that's just one example.
Can I ask you a question?
I know you're married.
Were you married then?
No, I was not married then.
Oh, so then you could go and hang out with ladies of the night and exchange cash.
And that sounds like a pretty good, a pretty fun gig.
And one that you could get away with because you weren't married.
I can just see you at one of these brothels doing this.
(0:48:38)</p>
<p>When you're talking, were you trying to get information back out of these women of ill repute, these ladies of the night, to see if somebody was talking to them?
Well, yes.
What we did was we approached them and we told them right up front, uh, you're going to have tricks that are Air Force or military people.
And they might tell you some information that could be classified.
(0:49:04)</p>
<p>So we want to know about that.
And we're going to pay you money.
So sure enough, they'll call, they'd call us.
Not everyone.
I mean, there were a lot of Air Force people that went there and there and did their thing and paid their 30 or $40 for their pleasure and never said anything or never disclosed anything.
But there were a lot of them that went in there and tried to impress the prostitutes by saying, you know, I'm working on this really classified project out there.
(0:49:34)</p>
<p>And, and, you know, there's aliens out there and these things like that.
Wow. So what they would do is they would immediately contact us and, and say, listen, we got it.
You know, I had a trick that told me some information.
So then we had to go out there and it wasn't just me.
There were a lot of other agents involved in this.
(0:49:55)</p>
<p>And they were going out there and they would talk to, to the, to the prostitute and say, well, you know, he's just trying to impress you.
None of that stuff is real.
You know, and, and we would have to give, provide them with this information.
And so that's how it worked.
And we actually, one Air Force pilot that was flying back in those days in the early eighties, uh, the F-117 stealth aircraft was, uh, uh, was being tested out there.
(0:50:27)</p>
<p>And it's highly classified back then.
This pilot went in and told her, his prostitute that he was flying this really super secret plane called the F-119, not the F-117. And he told, he told them that he told his prostitute that all the technology was from the aliens. They gave it to us.
(0:50:49)</p>
<hr>
<p>So, uh, they, you know, we had to really, really press this particular prostitute.
And, uh, we ended up, uh, finding the, of course, finding the Air Force captain, kicking him out of the program and kicking him out of the Air Force. So, yeah, I can, I can hear it now.
Dougherty sure is spending a lot of time out at Mary's fun palace.
But okay.
(0:51:34)</p>
<p>So is there a certain amount of, you know, going back to social media today and the way that you did things in the past, is there some element of truth in with the misinformation and disinformation to, to keep it feeling real?
Yes. You have to provide some real information in order for your target to believe it.
And, and it may be just a little bit, or it may be a lot in order for them to buy into it.
(0:52:06)</p>
<p>And, um, and then, and then you have, you have people that are very smart that you're dealing with such as Linda Howell. I mean, okay. I was going to bring that up. Okay. So, uh, many may not know what we're about to talk about. So I'm just going to give a brief summary. Um, and, uh, I've got to disclose.
I've spoken to Linda at length about this privately.
(0:52:33)</p>
<p>I've spoken to Rick about this at length privately. I've gotten both sides of the story. I'm going to say that 90% of it completely interlocks. Okay. All right. And so, uh, basically, uh, Linda was invited out to Kirkland and was promised, uh, she was in the middle of this HBO documentary that, uh, was in the works and it was in pre-production. Um, there was some, uh, the white house was, uh, she was trying to get I think that HBO wanted the white house involved and the president involved.
(0:53:09)</p>
<p>And so with all of this, she's invited out to Kirkland. She is going to be presented some documents and she, uh, goes into your office. Um, you had a mirror, you were videotaping. I think she even saw a camera above her. I think she said that there was a camera in the room. Um, and you told her that she could read the documents, but she couldn't take them with her.
(0:53:38)</p>
<p>Right now. Um, so that's, that's the summary of it. Now let's go back to, uh, the contents of those documents. Was some of it facts, uh, with disinformation and as a matter of fact, disinformation, misinformation, two different definitions. Um, we'll circle back to that for some clarification, but, uh, what was the purpose of showing Linda these docs? Uh, was it to find her sources? Uh, was it, was there something else involved there that had nothing to do with UFOs?
(0:54:13)</p>
<p>We needed to find her sources. We knew, uh, I got involved in this late. I mean, there were other agencies involved in this operation. Um, we knew that she was coming to, uh, and I'm not going to go into great details of how we knew all this stuff, but we knew what she was doing.
(0:54:40)</p>
<p>Okay. We knew where she was going. We knew who she was talking to for the most part. And we knew she was coming to Albuquerque. And so she was invited by me, uh, through, uh, Jerry Miller, um, who worked with me to the base. And I was going to talk to her and show her something, uh, that would help her in her, with her UB, uh, HBO special.
(0:55:05)</p>
<p>So, so she came out to the base and like you said, she was in a room, uh, to make way mirror, there were agents on the other side filming her. Plus it was a camera inside. We had a microphone in there too. She was fully aware that we were filming. I know at one point years ago, she said she didn't, but she's smart.
(0:55:30)</p>
<p>She told me, she looked up and saw a camera like above the door and she was sitting in the middle of the room. Your desk was on one end, right? Okay. Yeah. That's the way that she presented that with me. And she said that the chair was awkwardly placed. Right?
(0:55:43)</p>
<hr>
<p>We had to get her right in front of the right. Anyways, uh, now the day before these documents came in through a pouch, uh, armed forces courier pouch. So I knew they were top secret from headquarters now. Uh, and I was told the pro the, the, the operation was to show her these documents.
She couldn't take any notes and she couldn't keep anything.
(0:56:17)</p>
<p>She couldn't take any photographs of anything. So I had a chance prior to showing them to her to read them. Now I'm the middle guy.
Now I'm not, you got to understand that I didn't know what headquarters knew. I was, this is what I was told to do. And I did what I was told to do. I gave them to her. She read them.
(0:56:41)</p>
<p>She started asking me questions about them. Some of the questions I could answer, some of them I couldn't. Now, what we were hoping that after reading these documents, which I know that some of the information in there was accurate, but a lot of the information in there wasn't accurate. What we were hoping was she'd come around to our side because she had two sources within the government that was providing her information that was of classified, it was classified information.
(0:57:17)</p>
<p>So we wanted to know who those people were. And that was the basis of our operation against Linda Howell. So after I showed her those, I said to her, listen, I'd like to get to know you, like know what you're doing as far as programming and so forth. And she said, sure, you know, you can never have too many friends.
(0:57:43)</p>
<p>So I kept a friendship with her trying to delve into this. I've met her in Washington, D.C. I've met her in New York City, trying to find these people. Well, first of all, Linda Howell, very brilliant person.
And she knew what I was trying to do and she wasn't going to run with it.
In fact, we were having we were in Georgetown at a cafe having lunch and I pitched her.
(0:58:19)</p>
<p>I did the pitching by saying, listen, what I want you to do is work for us. We'll pay you. You just tell me what you know. And she just sat there and listened to me for some time and she said, not no, but hell no, in a polite way. She was a tough cookie to crack. Anyways, I maintained contact with her for some time and then another agent became involved with that operation.
(0:58:59)</p>
<p>But that's that's how it went. And we actually accomplished one of the was to end the HBO special because they were going to air something that we didn't want, that the government didn't want, U.S. intelligence didn't want. And we were able to end that. And so part of our mission was successful.
Let's take our break right here.
(0:59:26)</p>
<p>And when we come back, there's a reason why Rick shared that with us. And in today's world, in social media, by leaking or presenting information to individuals, will they turn around and post it on social media? And that is a very, very effective tool to see who's talking and who is not and how you can turn around and get the conversation going when you need it. We're going to talk more about that when we come back after this short break.
(0:59:59)</p>
<p>Our guest tonight, Rick Doty. We're talking about misinfo, disinfo, and ufology and our UFO community.
(1:00:07)</p>

(1:04:54)</p>
<p>This is Micah Hanks of The Graylian Report, and you're listening to Jimmy Church on Fade to Black. Welcome back. Fade to Black. I'm your host, Jimmy Church. Tonight, Rick Doty is with us. We're talking about misinformation and disinformation in the UFO community and ufology in general.
(1:05:32)</p>
<hr>
<p>Listening to the break there with Micah Hanks, I just spent the weekend with Micah. I haven't had that much fun. I haven't laughed that hard in a very long time. Micah Hanks is amazing, and more on what we were doing coming up here very soon, and we'll have full disclosure on that. Hey, Rick, let's get into some definitions real quick as we get to the meat of the matter, what's going on today. What's the difference between misinformation and disinformation?
(1:06:04)</p>
<p>Let's go in alphabetical order. What is disinformation? Disinformation is false information provided to deceive someone, something, some entities, some government.
Misinformation is the actual information that is given. That's going to be misinformation rather than the actual bread and butter. We're going to change it around. Misinformation is normally given to a person.
(1:06:44)</p>
<p>Disinformation is part of an operation. Oh, I got you. Oh, that's a big difference. Okay. Misinformation would be like the document or what is verbally said. Yes, exactly.
And disinformation is the agenda. All right. Okay. Got you. Got you.
I got to be very careful on how I'm wording this. I have been told lots of things over the years, of course.
(1:07:14)</p>
<p>Okay. All right. I have lots of people approach me, and I have relationships out there, but I don't share it. I keep it all inside. I don't talk to people about it. I don't get on the phone and go, guess what? I don't do that. And I don't speak about it on the air.
And I think that there is a couple of things that have happened because of that.
(1:07:36)</p>
<p>One, if anybody is attempting to use a disinformation campaign or give misinformation to me, it doesn't work because I don't turn around and share it. But there's a second thing that has resulted from this. I observe. Right? So I know what I'm told. So I listen to what other people are saying.
(1:08:10)</p>
<p>And I read what other people are posting. And I see if it is also out there because I know what I was told, allegedly, you know, in confidence. Right? And that it's getting out there in other areas. And sometimes it's even changed a little bit. And so I look back with squinty eyes and I go, okay, all right, there's something going on here.
(1:08:33)</p>
<p>But I don't talk about it. And I don't want to be a part of the story. But I will certainly observe. And that's the case.
And I watch this and it is going on right now, today. Oh, yes. You know, the social media today is something I wish we would have had years ago. But social media is a public forum.
That means anyone can access it.
(1:09:14)</p>
<p>And of course, that means government entities, such as Air Force Intelligence, DIA, CIA, FBI, DEA. So the social media opens up a wide range of access into the public itself. And the government is taking advantage of these social medias, Twitter, so forth and so on. So it's easy to post something on in some chat room, or on Facebook, or on Instagram or Twitter, Twitter thread with a cutout, meaning the United States Air Force isn't going to post it.
(1:10:12)</p>
<p>But somebody within Air Force Intelligence is going to contact somebody else who will contact the third person that will post it.
(1:10:18)</p>
<hr>
<p>So it can't come back to US intelligence. And then they're going to watch what happens with that information. I've seen it on Twitter in the last few weeks. UFO, UAP information, UAP, people wanting us to believe something about the UAP program. They post something about Lou Elizondo, or Chris Mellons, or me, or somebody else.
(1:10:48)</p>
<p>And then they want it, and they see how far it runs. So it's happening. It's happening. It's happened for ever since social media has been in existence. Now, will that change people's minds? Yes, it will change people's minds.
It will bring people in or push people out. And that's what somebody wants. They want, and maybe the government, and I don't know this for a fact, I know people are going to say, well, maybe I'm still in the government.
(1:11:25)</p>
<p>I'm not. I have a group of people that I'm working with, and where I'm at right now, actually, Jimmy, I'm going to disclose that I moved from one place that I was talking to you about yesterday to another location closer to you. So I'm actually in the same time zone as you, with some people having meetings about some other things that we're trying to do, including a U.S. Senator. So we're on one side of this disclosure.
(1:11:52)</p>
<p>Chris and Lou is on another team trying to get this disclosure. I'm not involved with them, and they're not involved with us. So I can tell you right now that I'm not aligned with Lou Elizondo or Chris Mullins. They have their own agenda. I was invited into their group, as some of the other people have that I'm working with, but we've politely said, no, we're going to do it in a different way and want disclosure out there. We want disclosure.
(1:12:24)</p>
<p>But there are entities within the government that do not want disclosure. And one of them is the United States Space Force. They do not want... the Colonel, if people have looked at YouTube in the last several months, during one of his interviews, one of the Colonels at Colorado Springs and Air Force Base specifically says, we're not cooperating with any disclosure project.
They don't want it out there. Because right now the Space Command has the UFO files.
(1:12:58)</p>
<p>I know that for a fact. And so they want to keep things secretive.
Now there's other entities within the government that want the subject out. I think the fact that they had the congressional hearings some time ago this summer, that was a flop, total flop, because the two people that were there to answer questions, although they were very honorable people, they had no idea what they were talking about.
(1:13:32)</p>
<p>They had no idea about anything in the past, no history whatsoever. They didn't even know what Roswell was. That's right. Randall Shimm. It's just ridiculous that they have them out there and they couldn't answer any of the questions.
What about the ability to have a fake account, you know, on Twitter or on Facebook or on Instagram or TikTok, whatever.
(1:14:12)</p>
<p>It's got to be very inexpensive because I picture a platoon, in the Air Force, NSA, whatever, sitting in a room running social media where one enlisted person has 100 accounts that they're running and they're out there established in social media and running an agenda, a disinformation campaign. Oh, that's true. Yeah, exactly. In fact, we interviewed two weeks ago, we interviewed a female who had just got out of the Air Force. She served six or seven years in.
(1:14:55)</p>
<p>She got out of the Air Force and we interviewed her on camera for a show that's going to appear sometime later. She was in that group. She was sitting in a bunker, a below ground bunker, and she was in the Air Force and her job was to monitor social media and spread information that she was told to spread.
(1:15:23)</p>
<p>That's all her job was in her six years in the Air Force. That's what she did. And there were, as you said, another platoon, well, in the Air Force, they call them flights. There was a whole flight of people in this room in front of very sophisticated computers monitoring and spreading information. I mean, she had fully admitted it.
(1:15:52)</p>
<p>She told us some things that I don't want to talk about now, but how they did things and how they were able to get stuff out and how the accounts were set up, which is quite extraordinary. They were using real names of real people with their sanctioned. They were paid. These people are, you know, John Doe from Flint, Michigan as a real person, but they're using his name and his identity, and he's fully aware of it, to set these accounts up.
(1:16:26)</p>
<p>It has to be done that way. It has to be effective because if anybody's going to go backwards and look into one of these accounts, you'd see that it's an actual real person.
(1:16:39)</p>
<hr>
<p>And if you want to do a deeper dive, you could probably even get their address and employment information. Then you find out that they're real people. It's just not a made up name like Ben Gaspett, fill my pockets, right, or whatever, that these are actual names. And I want to circle back for a second.
(1:17:10)</p>
<p>You mentioned the Space Force. There's something weird going on in social media with Lou Elizondo and the Space Force, that he is a member of the Space Force. And I don't believe that he is. And it's not that I'm questioning this. I think that this is the way that it is handled out there on social media, not directly from Lou himself.
(1:17:30)</p>
<p>He could be a paid consultant or something. But to be a member of Space Force, you have to be enlisted, right?
You have to be in uniform. I've been to the Space Force base here in California. I saw SpaceX launch myself. I interacted with Space Force personnel, and they are all in uniform, right? And so is that misinformation and disinformation on social media to present Lou as an enlisted member of the Space Force when indeed he is not? That could be very well.
(1:18:12)</p>
<p>I've heard this, and I've had a number of emails sent to me asking me that same question. I don't know that he's associated at all with Space Force. I don't know if that's just disinformation that's being spread by somebody to discredit Lou. But you're right. They'd have to be members. They would have to be either enlisted or an officer, or they would have to be some civilian GS-level employee.
(1:18:42)</p>
<p>And I don't think he is. But again, I don't know for a fact. I just heard the same rumor you have.
I like this comment here from the chat room. Sounds like UFO Twitter was created by the Air Force to misinform us. And I don't know much about UFO Twitter. And I haven't participated.
(1:19:08)</p>
<p>I don't know anything about it. And it's a small part of the UFO community. The UFO community is huge. And I would say that the majority of the UFO community isn't on Twitter at all, right, let alone UFO Twitter. But what goes on there certainly could be controlled through fake accounts and those that want to influence opinion.
Oh, absolutely.
(1:19:41)</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely. And you can easily influence... it wouldn't take much work to misinform and disinform people on social media. I mean, just one little bit of information can travel to millions of people. And then that little bit, those millions will send it to more.
And next thing you know, if you plan it right, you're going to get 20 or 30 million people thinking or reading the same thing and starting to change their opinion on something.
(1:20:13)</p>
<p>Yeah, because I was getting... this is what I found really, really strange, is I started to get a flood of email from people saying, you need to be careful, Church, because Lou is a member of the Space Force. And he knows what's going on. And I thought, where did this rumor get started? Member? Member of the Space Force? I don't think a member of the Space Force is hanging out on social media.
(1:20:47)</p>
<p>I just don't think Washington would like for something like that to be going on. But people, once you post it out there enough times, it becomes truth. That's right. That's exactly how it works. Exactly how it works. And we used to post things in newspapers. And of course, we didn't have the internet back in those days. But we would post things in newspapers or we'd co-op news people.
(1:21:19)</p>
<p>When I was in Kirtland, we had sources within every entity of the news business, newspapers, the radio stations, and the television stations. And if we wanted something aired, we got it aired. If we didn't want something aired, they wouldn't air it, or they would distort it for us. And that's how it is. The only way we could manipulate the local surroundings would be owning the television or newspaper. And also, I was watching the comments here in the chat room.
(1:22:03)</p>
<p>Yes, Rick is at a secret location. He's at a hotel somewhere in the middle of the desert doing the show tonight. And there you go. Well, I'm going to talk about that if I get a chance about why I'm here. Okay. No. Why? Why are you there? Okay. A few months ago, well, several months ago, we, our group, got a hold of an inter-control roster for all of Area 51. The roster was dated from January 1st, 1979 to December 31st, 1990. It's on one of these old computer dot matrix, I'm sure you've seen them before, 24-inch wide computer printouts.
(1:23:01)</p>
<p>Right. The form feed, form feed printer. Yeah, form feed printer. There's about 3,000 pages.
(1:23:07)</p>
<hr>
<p>Everyone that had access to Det 3 Air Force Test and Test Flight Center, which was at Area 51, Air Force Research and Development Operations Center, which was right in that same area, Southern Nellis Test Range, which is just north of Creech Air Force Base, in that area there, Site Sydney, which is a communications site, and Site Homey, which is the actually airfield at Area 51. So, what we're doing now is we're going through that and we're going to out people who claim to have been there during that time period.
(1:23:54)</p>
<p>Now, it's only between January 1st, 1979 to December 31st, 1990. Everyone that had access to those locations, their last name, first name, middle initial. Okay, Bob Lazar, is he on that? Yes, he is.
Bob Lazar is on that list, but only for a very short period of time. And we're going to go through this and we're going to out some people and we're going to go back and show that some people who claim that they were there and nobody wants to believe them, they were there.
(1:24:35)</p>
<p>And this has a lot of other information on it, but it's only during that time period. Now, we can't say who was there after that or even before that, but there's a lot of people out there who claim to have been there during that time period that they weren't there. We can prove that they weren't there.
(1:24:57)</p>
<p>They didn't have any access. Now, all we're going to say is your name's not on it. Is your name on it? Oh, my name's on it. Yes. The first thing I looked at was my name and it's there. My name is there. And the people that I've worked with that are former retired intelligence officers that were there, their names are there too.
So everyone who claims within the intelligence community that I've spoken with or that have talked to me about it or went public, who spoke with Annie Jacobson and Alex Ward, they're on it. Every one of those people that Annie spoke with, they're on it.
(1:25:39)</p>
<p>And some of them for the entire period of time. And then there's some people out there who are making these wild accusations about being out there and seeing things and doing things.
Their name's not on there. And all we're going to do is say, listen, your name's not on here.
Why is it on there? Let them talk about that.
(1:26:03)</p>
<p>And that's what our project is right now. I mean, that's one of our projects. And that's part of this documentary that we're going to do.
There's a lot of people involved, good producers and directors involved.
It's behind the time because of COVID. We had to stop filming. We were filming all around Area 51, setting up trail cameras, filming everything that was flying out of Area 51 or the Nellis Test and Training Range. It's going to be a great, great documentary.
(1:26:33)</p>
<p>I mean, a fantastic documentary. Once we get it finished and we had to go back and cut some things out because the Air Force wanted to file an injunction against us because of what we saw and what we did. So we had to do some cutting out. And along with that, we're going to out these people who claimed they were there.
(1:27:03)</p>
<p>But Bob Lazar was there. I mean, his name's on there. Very interesting. Can I circle back real quick before we get to the break? You mentioned that there was something that was supposed to be in Linda's HBO documentary that the Air Force didn't want in there. What was that?
(1:27:14)</p>
<hr>
<p>It was the it was she was talking about an incident that happened prior to the 1974 landing at Holloman Air Force Base. Kevin Egger supposedly was going to gave her saw the film. Linda had access to something that the government didn't want anybody to see. It was still classified. HBO had it. And then HBO turned it over to some of our intelligence people.
(1:27:49)</p>
<p>What did HBO have? Did they have film or did they have?
They actually had the original film.
Really?
Yeah. And some of it has leaked out. I mean, that there's there's a 15 second 50, I believe it was 15 seconds.
Yeah, yeah, we've all seen that. But the actual real I mean, that's the minutes. It was 33 minutes.
Yeah, that's the Holy Grail of ufology.
(1:28:18)</p>
<p>I've talked to a couple of people that one that saw a copy of another one that saw the actual now talk to the producers and and and stuff that were involved in M and Eggers project. But that's the Holy Grail, right? Where is the original film?
Yeah, that's I mean, I've seen it. Well, I haven't seen the 33 minutes.
I saw that, of course, a 15 second one you can look at.
(1:28:44)</p>
<p>And then I saw the I think it was seven seven minutes or something. I can't remember exactly how long it was. It was less than 10 minutes. I believe it was seven seconds, seven minutes, which was extraordinary.
I mean, it showed the landing and showed the creatures coming out of the spaceship.
That doesn't show the meeting with the military people, but because that's on the other the rest of the 26 minutes that there's people that talked about it.
(1:29:17)</p>
<p>I mean, I know that Hal Puthoff had a friend that saw the whole thing and thought it was extraordinary and knew it wasn't made by the government because it was, you know, a 1964 incident. And so the government got what they wanted. I mean, the operation was successful. They got it back.
And what did Linda? I've never talked to Linda about this. Did she see it?
(1:29:44)</p>
<p>I'm not sure. You'd have to ask her.
Executives at HBO that saw the Holloman film that there are civilians out there outside of ufology that have seen this? Well, all I can say is I knew they had it. I don't know if you know who saw it, but I knew and that wasn't my operation. It was the agents that were working in New York area and Washington. So I didn't have access to everything that they were doing there, but they got the film back.
(1:30:21)</p>

You are listening to Fade to Black with Jimmy Church on the Game Changer Network. I'm Lee Sievans, you're listening to Jimmy Church. This is a revolution. The revolution will not be televised. The revolution is on radio. Ciao. Welcome back Fade to Black. I'm your host Jimmy Church. Tonight Rick Doty is with us.
(1:36:51)</p>
<p>We're talking about misinfo, disinfo inside of the UFO community and the possibility of that. And Rick just, yeah, Rick just dropped a bomb on us with this list of names and Bob Lazar, a list of names from workers at Area 51. I just popped that out on Twitter. So in your secret identity on Twitter, Rick, you can go and read that.
(1:37:27)</p>
<p>And the men in black should be knocking on your door pretty soon. I hope you've made copies of this list and you've got some stashed away. Well, when we first obtained it, we had a problem finding some place to copy it. I mean, it's not an easier, yeah. Right, right.
(1:37:45)</p>
<hr>
<p>And so we didn't want to go to a business like Staples or Office Depot or Office Max, but we actually found a library at a college that has an old printing system that can copy it. So that's what we did. And then we had to verify it. We had to make sure it was in fact government, that it, you know, wasn't, was the real thing.
(1:38:16)</p>
<p>And that was easy to do because just by the nature of it and by the markings on it, it wasn't classified. It's not classified.
We submitted FOIA requests to get, to verify that the existence that it's real.
And there's a code on it, the top of it. And when the government, the DIA, was the administrative controller for this, they initially told us that they couldn't release it.
(1:38:51)</p>
<p>And I said, well, we already have it. We already have it. You want to come and look at it?
We can't mail it to you, but here it is. And then they came back and said, oh yeah, okay, we can verify it. It's not classified. It's obsolete. So they're not going to, they're not going to comment on it. So now we have that letter saying, okay, it's obsolete.
(1:39:13)</p>
<p>And it's basically verification that it's real. And then we went and we found a lot of people, I'm sure there's a lot of people on this list that are dead. And we did verify some of that, but we went back and verified a lot of people who are still alive that are retired from different agencies. Now this is a list of everyone, including military, civilian contractors, and government employees.
(1:39:52)</p>
<p>Raytheon, Hughes Aircraft, Motorola, General Dynamics, Lockheed, before it was Lockheed Martin. All those, their names are on there, people that worked.
We went and found a lot of people. In fact, where we are right now, we came to speak to some people that are retired and that are on that list. And they're going to verify, and we're going to get them on camera to say, yeah, yeah, I was there during that time period. And just to verify that.
(1:40:21)</p>
<p>And then there's people from Los Alamos and Sandia. But ironically, there's names of people that are associated with a contractor. And we know that contractor is basically a cover for the CIA. So there's nobody on this list with their name associated with the Central Intelligence Agency. It's all some other cover. Sure. Well, yeah, it ran that way for a long time.
I mean, the base was constructed by the CIA. It was originally a CIA back when it was called the Ranch and Dreamland. It was CIA. Staffed by Air Force, I think Air Force Security. Okay. This is pretty exciting.
(1:41:21)</p>
<p>I feel like that's pretty major. But is it misinformation from Richard Doty presented to Jimmy Church on Fade to Black? So we'll leave that to the community.
But that's pretty cool, Richard. Well, there's other entities that got a hold of... we showed it to other people, even some people in the Air Force, current active duty people, a colonel that's kind of on our team, and some other people.
(1:41:50)</p>
<p>So it's real. We're going to copy it. And we're going to give... we're going to bring George Knapp in on this and some other people.
(1:41:57)</p>
<hr>
<p>Ironically, somebody who you would never think that had access out there, that had access, his name is on here, is Art Bell. Art Bell went to Area 51. He went to Nellis. Bell had access there from... well, it showed him having access on June 17, 1979, to September 19, 1979. He was a contract employee for BCRS, which is the... BCRS is the television station, the closed circuit television station for the base.
(1:42:49)</p>
<p>Get the hell out of here. Yeah, I know. I said the same thing. And I tell you what, I've known Art forever before he died. I mean, I've been out there to his house. I've been on his program.
And Art never mentioned that he was ever out there.
What?
Yep. Now, he was either somehow associated with the closed circuit TV station out there for I don't know what reason, maybe an advisor, maybe he set up some equipment for him or something to that. Now, one thing it doesn't show is a security clearance.
(1:43:31)</p>
<p>It doesn't show he had a security clearance. So maybe they just brought him out there to set something up for him. I don't know.
He's dead. So we can't talk to him about it. But he was out there in that short period of time.
I can't handle this. I can't handle this too much.
I couldn't handle it when I saw it.
(1:43:53)</p>
<p>I thought, well, it can't be the same Art Bell. And then I started looking and, you know, date of birth and stuff all matched his.
Okay. Oh, man, I've got a hundred million. Okay. We've got to get off on the subject because I want to get back to misinformation and disinformation. I feel like I am... I feel like a tool now.
(1:44:20)</p>
<p>You're feeding me this stuff. You're spreading it. Rick, you're spreading it right now. Wow. Really? I mean, Bob Lazar, that's hard enough to swallow.
I mean, only because he hasn't had anything, right? Everything has been completely circumstantial. But if this is the case, and this has got a document number on it, and, you know, you've researched the provenance and to make sure that it was what it is, but to have Bob Lazar's name on it, you know, the UFO community is... I've already posted it in Twitter, you know, and we'll see how this goes. Okay. Let's swing this back around though.
(1:45:04)</p>
<p>Now, back to what is going on on social media and through... If you're going to do this, you're going to do this in all media outlets. There is something pretty effective going on, Rick, and that is UAPs are technology here on earth, man-made. Then you have the other side that some of it, most of it is alien and is visiting us.
(1:45:42)</p>
<p>And there seems to be something going on right now in social media that is trying to push this away from the alien conversation, and that the alien conversation is a cover-up of highly classified technology that the United States is in possession of. And it's got people arguing and fighting about this right now.
(1:46:03)</p>
<hr>
<p>Is that a disinformation campaign? Oh, I would say so, yes. It sounds that way to me, although I don't know anything other than what I read on the social media. But if I was to run an operation to protect some kind of special access program, knowing that this information we have, the technology that we have at Area 51 or wherever, is that we obtained somewhere, yeah, I would protect it the same way.
(1:46:41)</p>
<p>Now, what is confusing is that Chris Mellons sent something out saying, let's get away from the UFO. Let's only talk about UAPs and only in the context of what the Navy wants to talk about. I find that disingenuous, because why? Let's keep the subject open. Historically speaking, we didn't have UAPs, we had UFOs, or we had known alien crafts.
(1:47:22)</p>
<p>We had identified alien craft, IACs. I mean, that's in documents that Stan Friedman had seen, and it's in some of the MJ-12 documents. We know some is factual and some is not. But we have to keep the subject open in a wider sense than what some people want us not to involve. And Chris Mellons mentioned that stuff earlier, and I read that, what he talked about, and I scratched my head.
(1:47:59)</p>
<p>Why is he saying that? Let's talk about every single realm of the UFO phenomenon. Let's keep that out there. Let's not close any books on that. Because if you close a book and say, let's just leave that over there, and we're going to talk only about this subject, that's going to block out a lot of good information that needs to stay out there in public to force disclosure.
(1:48:28)</p>
<p>And the more we can press the government on disclosure, the more that we can push knowledge that we have out here into the government, letting them know what we know, I think there's more of a chance for disclosure.
The recent announcement that, and this came through FOIA, John Greenwald in the Black Vault, does some of the best work out there in chasing down the facts, and does it through official government documents.
(1:49:11)</p>
<p>And so he submitted a FOIA request for all UAP videos, right? Blanket, I just want all UAP videos. And they came back and said, we've got them, but you're not going to see them. And they have now been labeled classified. That's it, in the interest of national security, right? Which is always the blanket that is put over these things, national security, and everybody freaks out on that, and they end up not touching it.
(1:49:37)</p>
<p>I feel like that is almost a misdirection and misinformation too, as well. And if it's from outer space, if it's interstellar, if it's not ours, then what does that have to do with national security?
And let me give you an example, because the government is going to say, well, it's how we detect these things.
(1:50:07)</p>
<p>We don't want the Russians to know how good our equipment is, our sensor data, we can't let that out. This is not sensor data. This is called a cell phone.
(1:50:15)</p>
<hr>
<p>And if a pilot is shooting something from his cockpit on a cell phone, that is not secret radar-fleer technology, right, on an aircraft that is picking this stuff up, or satellites.
It's a cell phone. Should we be entitled to see these things?
Well, first of all, the government always wants to protect sources and methods.
I was involved with this for 12 years, whereby you have some sort of a source and a method to detect or gather intelligence.
(1:51:02)</p>
<p>And our government says, we're not going to disclose sources or methods. Now, as an example, the congressional hearing, they had a closed camera. After they were in the public view, they went behind a camera, they call it in-camera, into a classified setting. You know what they talked about?
They talked about sources and methods, how we filmed that tic-tac, how we did... they didn't disclose anything other than that, because I had a senator tell me.
(1:51:35)</p>
<p>He said that they didn't talk about anything other than sources and methods. And they didn't even talk about the sources or methods. They just said, we have a source that can detect this, and we have a method to detect these things. But that's all they talked about. Well, let me tell you something. There's a secret space program out there, and the secret space program is deep space probes.
(1:52:01)</p>
<p>We have satellites all over space, in our solar system, that can detect things coming in. Now, they're classified.
Now, this colonel at Space Command... well, this was before the US Space Force. This was when Space Command was still in existence back in 2014. He said, we have 174 methods of detecting things coming in from the solar system.
(1:52:36)</p>
<p>He just disclosed right there, there's 174 deep space probes we have out there. But he didn't say that. He just said 174. Okay, so if you dig deep into what we have, what we know, and what others have talked about, including people within our employer there, Gaia, and other entities, we've launched things out of... the pilots of one of the Discovery in 1983 admitted that they launched a classified project, a classified satellite, into deep space. He admitted it.
(1:53:21)</p>
<p>He told the public that. Okay, so we have objects, we have space satellites out there, and they're detecting things coming in all the time. But the government doesn't want us to know, or doesn't want you to know, that we have these deep space probes. So they can't disclose methods or sources of information of how these things are being detected.
(1:53:42)</p>
<p>Now, the Navy said, we're not going to disclose any more of these videos. The Air Force said the same thing.
Well, the Air Force never did disclose theirs. The Air Force has 110 of them sitting in a classified vault that would scare the dickens out of anyone that saw them. But they're not going to disclose them. And so the Coast Guard, the United States Coast Guard has them.
(1:54:16)</p>
<p>They don't have jets. They have C-130 cargo planes, and rescue planes, and helicopters. And one over the northwest off Vancouver Island, for 40 minutes, they filmed these two spacecraft, alien spacecraft, flying saucers, as what the pilot and the co-pilot said, flying around their helicopters. They filmed it.
(1:54:43)</p>
<hr>
<p>Well, that's classified. It was taken over by the Navy, and the Navy says that's classified.
So there's things out there, even the Canadian government, the Canadian Air Force has things that they're not going to disclose, that have happened, that they've filmed. So we have to get we have to get the government, we have to get Congress to put pressure on the military to release these things.
(1:55:16)</p>
<p>Now, I understand that there's a different branch, because the military is in the executive branch, but there's things that you can, methods that Congress can take to put pressure on the military to release some of this stuff. Now, if we still had Harry Reid around, God bless his soul, and he was still in the Senate, I think he could have done it.
(1:55:40)</p>
<p>But unfortunately, we don't have anybody in the Senate now, in leadership, that will do that. Because supposedly, Schumer, Dick Schumer, and McConnell, were briefed to keep their mouth shut. That's what one of the senators told us, and they won't even bring it up in the Senate. So that's what we have right now.
(1:56:14)</p>
<p>We're making our efforts to get disclosure inside government. But at this time right now, there's a block. There's a roadblock ahead of us. Now, the ODNI report that came out last August, was that well-crafted wordsmith disinformation? Yeah, I would say so. Absolutely. I mean, it caused the conversation to swing in another direction. In another direction, exactly.
Yeah. And we've also missed, and I've been watching some of the chatter out there from some very interesting accounts, about the missing of the report that we were supposed to already have this year. Now we're sitting on, today is September 14th, we missed the six-month window.
(1:57:06)</p>
<p>There's allegedly one that's going to come out around Halloween, October, late October. And I'm wondering how that's going to be worded. And, you know, again, because you're guiding the masses with this, and engaging the comments, not only here in the UFO community, but to our adversaries around the world. Well, we're working with a senator who has informed us that some of the information that they were going to disclose in a report, they had to clear it through the military.
(1:57:58)</p>
<p>The military extracted, redacted many paragraphs in that. And I don't know how long the document was, but they redacted it. So all the good stuff, all the meat of that report that was supposed to come out in September, has been redacted by the government, by the military, by the intelligence community, because it discloses sources and methods, which I don't think it does.
(1:58:25)</p>
<p>I don't know, I didn't read it. I don't know what it contained. But some of the aides, some of the staff members who had clearances, tried to write it in a manner that was avoiding any kind of classification. But the government didn't, I guess the military didn't want it, or the U.S. intelligence didn't want it.
(1:58:56)</p>
<p>So I don't know where we are right now. What about the second, is there going to be a second UFO hearing? And will it be by the House, or will it kick up a level to the Senate, and the Intelligence Committee? It's supposed to be the Senate. They had a plan for the Senate to hold hearings, because the first one was Congress, the House of Representatives. This one is supposed to be done by the Senate, the Senate Intelligence Committee. But that was blocked by Chuck Schumer, who's in charge of the Senate right now, I guess because of what's occurring within the government.
(1:59:40)</p>
<p>And they want to keep some of these other things, the January 6th hearings, and things like that open, more open and available. And plus, the senators are going to be leaving here shortly for campaigning, because there's an election this year. So I don't think we're going to see it. And unfortunately, we're not going to see it.
(2:00:00)</p>
<hr>
<p>I think the Senate hearings, because we were more involved, our group was more involved in that, in our Senate hearing. And we were going to really, we had some excellent questions that we were going to pose to whoever the intelligence community placed in front of the hearing. And I understand there was going to be a general, an Air Force general and somebody from the Department of Defense. But I don't think those hearings are going to materialize at this point, which is a very, I mean, it's frustrating to people out here who really want disclosure.
(2:00:38)</p>
<p>I mean, we could have disclosure without disrupting the intelligence community, about disrupting research and development. Just the fact that yes, we've been visited, we have obtained materials from the ETs, just those things, those basic things that we want to know, the public wants to know. And we can do disclosure without harming the government.
And how it was collected and anything else that would be there in the interest of national security, certainly.

<p>You want to know a secret? I love ponies. I really love ponies. I'm serious.
I couldn't stay sane without ponies to brush.
Why Fade to Black? Because you never got that pony, dammit!
This is Fade to Black with Jimmy Church on the Game Changer Radio Network. Welcome back, Fade to Black. I'm your host, Jimmy Church. Tonight, Rick Doty is with us.
I can't handle it.
(2:05:22)</p>
<p>I can't take it anymore. Man, incredible. Incredible, Rick. What a great conversation tonight. And I want to flip things around, if I can. Recently, John Greenwald and the Black Vault presented a video that I watched about... I'm just going to call it... I don't have the exact name, and I'll leave that up to John. But it's a document, and everybody can go and watch it over on the YouTube channel.
(2:05:58)</p>
<p>It's an operations manual guide on classifications and dealing with UAP. And in this guide, I'm going to paraphrase, go and watch John's video because it's excellent.
But that all UAP data, everything needs to be classified. This stuff doesn't need to go out into the public, and if that's what it's dealing with... And now I'm paraphrasing, but the overall arching writer's author of this, and this is for the Department of Defense and for the three-letter agencies, I think that this is a pretty big deal.
(2:06:45)</p>
<p>The community itself, I don't think, is as aware of it as they should be. But does that alarm you that this kind of document is written and who wrote it? And I'm wondering if the author of this could possibly, you know, be out there on social media and gauging things and seeing how stuff is being dealt with, and they just want to just close this UAP issue down. Well, classification authority rests with a number of different agencies.
(2:07:16)</p>
<p>People can... different agencies can classify things. But the governing directive is DOD regulation 5200, and that's what you're talking about. It dictates when something needs to be classified, how it's supposed to be classified, whether it's going to be top secret with the caveats, with special access, whether it's going to be secret or confidential, which is the lowest classification you can get.
(2:07:52)</p>
<p>And then there's, of course, special categories such as if it dealt with nuclear weapons, it would be restricted data and so forth and so on.
Anyways, I get you, and I do think that this is the danger when the government starts thinking that everything, especially anything to do with UAPs, will be classified. That's ridiculous, number one. It's already out there in the public.
(2:08:21)</p>
<p>The TikTak videos, the Nimitz incident, the Roosevelt incident, some of these other incidents that have been filmed and released, that's in the public. It's very difficult to come back and say... Put the genie back in the bottle. Yeah, right, right. Yeah, so yeah, it worries me.
It really worries me that the government is collapsing, I think, because of Space Force, that now they're going to classify everything.
(2:09:00)</p>
<p>And what do you make of this? Okay, what's going on today in a very small segment, I might add, of social media? It's not all of ufology. But the ability to get UFO researchers that have been at this game for a long time, ufology is decades old. It's not Twitter old, right? It's not social media old.
(2:09:27)</p>
<hr>
<p>But this is something that was very effective in the past, was to get different researchers with different ideas and different data in fighting, right? And that's very effective, right? And I see that going on today. It's straight from the playbook, isn't it?
Oh, absolutely. There's more harm done from within the UFO community to themselves than anybody could done the outside.
(2:10:08)</p>
<p>Like Phil Klass said at that UFO convention in 2006, you people do more harm fighting amongst themselves than I could ever do from the outside.
I mean, and that's true. And it's true. I just get a kick out of these UFO conventions. And you and I have been there. And we've listened to some of these people argue back and forth over something because of a book or something like that.
(2:10:39)</p>
<p>And so they do more harm. I mean, if the UFO community could unite, I mean, fully unite behind a legitimate disclosure program, I think that would help the government seeing this. But listening to even during those hearings, those congressmen, they got their questions from UFO people. And some of the questions, you could read those questions, where they came from.
(2:11:21)</p>
<p>Yeah. And now our group is doing the same thing. I mean, we're forming questions for the senators to ask. And so we're probably just as blamed, much as blamed. But we're centering our questions around really legitimate events that happened. And let these people not... we're not talking generalities or philosophies. We're talking about actual events.
(2:11:51)</p>
<p>And we want to know about these events. We want to know really what happened at Roswell. I mean, I read about it. I know what happened. Let's talk about Randall Syme Forest. Let's see what really happened there that is still classified. I mean, the OSI report is still classified top secret. It's not going to be disclosed. And the portion that was released, the 63 pages, 54 were redacted all black.
(2:12:19)</p>
<p>You can't read anything. You can't even tell where it happened. So we need to... these things happened before. They happened in the past.
Let's start disclosure with what happened in the past and then work up to the present time.
That's the legitimate method we think disclosure should work. Now, there's another thing that's going on in social media.
(2:12:49)</p>
<p>And it's cross platforms. It's all there. You are going to... the UFO community in general does not trust anybody involved with the government, the Department of Defense, because they've been ridiculed for years. They have been teased.
They have been lied to. And trust is something that is going to come over time. It's not going happen in a couple of years.
(2:13:15)</p>
<p>It's just not going to be there. And then when you see what is going on with the UFO hearings and these reports and these claims coming out of, you know, the Navy and the Department of Defense and these statements that Washington is now our friend, that's not going to happen overnight.
(2:13:37)</p>
<p>And I see this ebb and flow going on in social media and comments from others that there is no way. If disclosure happens, that's fine. And we've got to keep the pressure on. But there is nobody associated with Washington, D.C. that is our friend.
(2:13:51)</p>
<hr>
<p>Oh, I agree with you 100 percent, Jimmy. You're right, right? You're right. And what can we do? How can we unite the UFO community?
We tried. I've tried. I've spoke at conventions. I've befriended a lot of people that really were against me. I've moved closer. I interact with people. You know, you and I years ago wouldn't have been friends.
(2:14:31)</p>
<p>We're friends now. I love you, Jimmy. I mean, you're a great guy. We have our differences in the past, but we can sit down and talk like men to men. You know, hey, this is what I've done and this is what I admit to. There's a lot of things I did in the past. And I'll admit that that wasn't pleasant, but I had a job to do. I was told to do this.
(2:14:48)</p>
<p>And so and there's people out there that are like me that want the truth out there and want it presented in a way that is believable. And the government, I don't think they're going to do it. You know, and the government plays, like you said earlier, they play the UFO community against each other. It's easy to do. It's a different disinformation campaign, but it's the easiest disinformation campaign you could ever run because of social media. You can plant one particular UFO group against another or one particular person within the UFO group against another.
(2:15:41)</p>
<p>It's easy to do. And I think the government, when they want to generate some animosity amongst the UFO group, that's exactly what they do. Well, I noticed something probably about six, seven years ago, you know, before TTSA, before the current drama, and how funny that TTSA is gone, right? With everything that happened in 2017, here we are, didn't take long to have that go away.
(2:16:15)</p>
<p>But before all of that, I would hear comments from people going, Jimmy, somebody just said, you know, they would say my name. I said, what? I had nothing, you know, I'm like, wait a minute. And then I would hear it again. I'd hear it again.
And I stepped back, Rick, I swear on all that is holy. I stepped back and went, there's games being played.
(2:16:42)</p>
<p>There are games being played. People saying things, you know, and that I know that I didn't speak to that person, or I didn't say this, or I didn't do that, that it was all BS. But, and it continues right now, right through 2022. And I, you know, and I just see it.
(2:17:04)</p>
<p>And it's not just with me, it's with a whole variety of people, where this is, this is going on. And, you know, and I know the sources, you know, it's very easy to triangulate this stuff back. And, and all I do is operate with squinty eyes, you know, and see how this plays out.
Well, there's, you know, there's a lot of people that don't like me, but there's, there's a lot of people that don't like you too, Jimmy. Because when, when the word got out that was going on your show, I got a lot of emails saying, why do you want to go on Jimmy's show?
(2:17:37)</p>
<p>Why do you want to go on Fade to Black? I said, I like Jimmy. I've, you know, I've been fences with him. I've been to UFO conventions. I've been, I mean, I, I don't know if we should say we got drunk together, but we did, but, but, you know, you, you, I, you air it the way it's supposed to be aired.
(2:18:07)</p>
<p>There's other people out there that don't. And I think people discredit you because you ask a lot of questions. You don't, you're not gullible. Yeah. And, and, and here's the other thing. I'm not here to ruffle feathers and I, I don't, I don't cause trouble. It's not in my nature. I'm, I'm more about learning and I, and I'm trying to get to, you know, the end of the road on this thing.
(2:18:37)</p>
<p>And that's, that's my goal. And that frustrates people that, and, and, and, and I get it. I can't be bought. I can't, well, send me a guitar. I'll get you on the show. But, but, but I'm not a show. I am my own person. And there are people out there that are very frustrated about that.
(2:19:03)</p>
<p>They don't get it. If Rick, this is the truth. And I'm not in any way speaking from an egocentric state of mind here. If anybody walked a day in my shoes and saw what I actually did, they would have a completely different opinion. A completely, they, oh, okay. Completely different.
(2:19:20)</p>
<hr>
<p>And, but, but they can't and they don't. So they write their own idea of what's really going on and who I am. And, and because I don't, I don't run my mouth and, and, and say things out in public.
I'm not posting in social media. I'm not, you know what I mean? I don't do that. So they don't have any ammunition to say anything.
(2:19:51)</p>
<p>So they make it up and it's just the way it is. And here's the other thing that really pisses people off. I don't give a crap. I don't give a crap. I don't see it. I don't read it. I don't hear it. I don't watch your stuff. I don't read your stuff. I don't I just don't, I don't give a crap.
(2:20:14)</p>
<p>You know, this show is just done with you and I talking and that's it without any outside influences. That's it. That's it. It makes people angry.
Oh, it does. It does. Especially knowing you don't really give a shit about, excuse me.
I do. I don't, I don't, I don't give a shit. I do not.
I don't know how to say this. I never swear on this show, but you know, okay. All right.
(2:20:38)</p>
<p>Everybody just freaked out. Jimmy just said the bad version of poo-poo. Well, we, we gotta have a voice out there. And I like your voice. I mean, I've listened to your show a lot. And you know, you have good guests and some I believe, some I don't. You know, and I'm up front with somebody if I don't, don't believe them.
(2:21:07)</p>
<p>And I like, I like to be, I like that to be. Well, and then there's other entities, other ways to get, get the word out.
And I think you know, I, I, I work at Gaia as you will be. I don't know if I should say that or not, but... That's dis-info. That's dis-info right there. You were given misinformation. Okay. But continue. But, but you know, Gaia has a good, a cosmic disclosure with Emory Smith. I've been on there for several years.
(2:21:48)</p>
<p>I have like 45 episodes. And some with, with somebody else, another person. I've, I've traveled the world. I've been to UK speaking, going back to the UK in October. I'm trying to get the word out. I'm trying to get the word out. You know, I don't use people anymore, such as Bill Moore or Jamie Shandera, as disinformation people.
That's, that era's over with.
(2:22:23)</p>
<p>I try to convince people of that. I'm, I'm the legitimate Rick Doty now. I'm, I'm not, I don't spread disinformation. I couldn't have, I couldn't be at Gaia. I couldn't have worked for the Institute for Advanced Studies the years that I worked there if, if I was one, if I was that bad person.
(2:22:42)</p>
<p>So I want to get the word out. I want to get disclosure out in the best way we can. I want to get everything that we, we've done, that we can legitimately talk about within the UFO community. Everything that we've, that, that we, the United States government, United States intelligence community has done from 1947, from the Roswell Crohn incident up until now.
(2:23:12)</p>
<p>How we do this, we have to do it in a, in a, in a way that the, the public will become involved with. Rather than telling the public, we should grasp the public's assistance and, and, and getting this out. And I'm doing a good job at it because I, you know, I used to get a lot of hate mail, but now our emails, now I get people who want to, want to help.
(2:23:43)</p>
<p>What can we do to get the word out? I said, you need to contact your, contact your Senator or Congressman and tell them you want, you want to know about this. You have a right as a United States citizen to know what our government's been doing.
(2:23:54)</p>
<hr>
<p>I wanted to before, and by the way, I don't care what you're doing in the morning, we're doing overtime. So, and that's going to come up here shortly. So, but anyway, you had mentioned earlier, I don't want, I don't need a lawsuit. I don't need names. So keep that part.
(2:24:22)</p>
<p>You said that there is somebody that you have been trying to out that is, is active right now in, in social media and in the community. Is there, you had mentioned on this show, it was probably four or five years ago now, that there were a couple of speakers in, in, in the UFO conference circuit that, that were agents, that were informants.
(2:24:52)</p>
<p>Yes. Is, is that going on today? I mean, is there, are there active members of Ufology that may not be who they say they are? Oh, yeah.
Yeah. I'm not going to mention names, but I know of three who are cooperating. I should say, yeah, they're cooperating assets for, for, for the U.S. intelligence service.
(2:25:27)</p>
<p>And what's their job? Well, their job is to report back what, what their group, what their UFO group, the ones I know are with, are in MUFON. And, and I, I know who they are. I talked to them. They don't really, well, one of them kind of hides it.
(2:25:50)</p>
<p>The other two don't really hide it. I mean, they, they're, they're not saying they work for the U.S. intelligence, but what they say is, I don't have anything to hide. I'll tell anyone this. I don't have anything to hide. And, but I know, I know things about them that will, will say, will tell me that they, they work, they have a handling agent, so to speak.
(2:26:11)</p>
<p>They're reporting back. And, and that's, you know, it's, it's only common sense that any, any group that is, that could obtain information relevant to research and technology or UFO activities, the government would want to know about it. So they're going to penetrate groups and they're going to have somebody in that group report back to them, just like I did with Bill Moore. I mean, I recruited Bill Moore. He was in APRO, you know, before MUFON, MUFON and APRO, APRO doesn't exist now.
(2:26:56)</p>
<p>He was also in CAUSE and, and I recruited him to report back to me everything that was going on within the UFO community regarding UFOs. And, and he did, he was one of my sources. And, and that hasn't changed today. They're still doing the same thing because I talk and, and I think we sat at the last UFO convention.
(2:27:19)</p>
<p>And I think I pointed out to you who the intelligence officers were in the crowd. There were three of them. And, and so they still go that US intelligence, either air force or, or, or DIA or even CIA, they go to these conventions.
Now, if they thought this was a, a, a non believable or a, a hoax, why would they send top line intelligence officers to these UFO conventions?
(2:27:50)</p>
<p>Well, okay. But there's, there's two ways to look at this. One is that they're collecting information to see what we know. Okay. There's that. But then there's the other side is they can be telling stories. Absolutely. Exactly. Exactly. You hit it right there, Jimmy. They're telling stories. They're spreading information. They're spreading information.
(2:28:14)</p>
<hr>
<p>And what is that? That's the misinformation. That's the misinformation of a disinformation campaign.
Yeah. It'll spread around a UFO conference pretty quickly too. I've had it happen. I've had, where I've had two or three people come up to me and go, so I just heard. And I was like, yeah, I've heard it now four times.
(2:28:41)</p>
<p>It's crazy how effective that is. I mean, it's, well, you could do the same thing in sports. You could do the same thing in, in a search engine company, right? Whatever. You want to just go and, and, and get something going. You can get it going pretty quickly. And it's, it's very interesting how, you know, the sewing circles, you know, the little guy, you know, boom. And it, and it, it proliferates so fast. But I'm very curious.
(2:29:08)</p>
<p>I don't know. Rick hasn't told me, so don't ask and, and, and things, but, but I'm very curious who, it's one thing to collect information, but who is out there, who's putting it out there into the UFO community. I'm very interested in that. I've got some ideas, you know, but that part doesn't matter, but I can see the, this ebb and flow.
(2:29:36)</p>
<p>And, and it's very easy to, you know, connect the dots, right. To triangulate, to GPS this thing. Well, I think your listeners who are within MUFON or the UFO community probably have a few ideas on, on, on these people. And I'm not going to disclose them. It's their business. They're out there doing their, their job, maybe, or I'm not going to disclose names, but they are there and they always will be somebody within these groups that are reporting back to US intelligence of what the group is doing or what new information they've gotten from new incidents that happened to you, both landings or ET contacts or abductions.
(2:30:25)</p>

This is KJCR at JimmyChurchRadio.com Welcome back. Fade to black. Going into overtime with Rick Doty. Yeah, man.
(2:36:20)</p>
<p>Wow. What a show tonight. I just... Art Bell. Art Bell. Bob Lazar. Just... Just mind blown tonight. Hang on.
Sometimes I just drink too much coffee during the break.
Overtime, Rick Doty. Overtime. Okay, now let's loosen up a little bit.
(2:36:47)</p>
<hr>
<p>And I want to go here.
Serpo. Misinformation, disinformation, government-funded campaign. What was it?
Well... It's a yes or no question, Rick. A little bit of both, I guess.
You know, that's a story and it's... I mean, that's a complex story.
If you go back and look at all the different players involved in this, Victor Martinez and Joe Yeager and... I mean, you know, I could name them forever.
(2:37:28)</p>
<p>And then me, I was feeding information off or getting information off other people.
Obviously, I wasn't around back in those days. I was a kid.
But there's some people that will swear by it.
And then there's some people will say, no, it was a disinformation campaign to scare the Russians. We wanted the Russians to think that we had contact with an extraterrestrial race and that would scare the Russians. Now, I think part of that's true. I think we did let the Russians know.
(2:38:18)</p>
<p>But on the other hand, there's a lot of things that can be verified that happened.
And there are people out there, unfortunately, they died, they're dead.
But there was one person out there who spoke from the heart about it happening.
Although there's a controversy about how many people went, whether it were 12 or three or one.
I know Linda Howell spoke many times about the Serpo or about what she knew and about the one person that she had contact with who had supposedly went.
(2:39:01)</p>
<p>And it came back. So I think there's a little bit of facts in a bucket that's mostly a counterintelligence operation.
Why would they try to mislead, excuse me, mislead the Russians in something like this and having the Russians believe that we were sending and trading personnel with a planet called Serpo?
I mean, what's to gain with the Russians believing a story like that?
(2:39:47)</p>
<p>Well, there's a number of different facets to that.
Number one, if the Russians were to believe that we had contact with an extraterrestrial race, that would mean that the extraterrestrial race could be providing us with advanced weapons or advanced research technology. And that would scare the Russians, number one, thinking that we had something they didn't have as far as a weapons system goes or even space travel.
(2:40:24)</p>
<p>And the Russians back in the 60s had somewhat of an advantage on human intelligence, a human meaning spies. We had an open society. They didn't. It was easy for them to keep track of their people. It was not easy for us to keep track of our people.
I know in an intelligence operations course, we learn history.
(2:41:01)</p>
<p>And one of the things we learned was that from the 50s on through the 60s, the Soviets had an easy job of keeping track of our spies. And we had a difficult job of keeping track of their spies. So I think that all played into this thing that, hey, we got something that you don't have. And I think that's part of the operation. Although I don't know for a fact. I know CIRPL means something to U.S. intelligence.
(2:41:44)</p>
<p>The word CIRPL, it's something to do with special extraterrestrial planet or something. There's an actual meaning of CIRPL, which just came out here a little while ago. Somebody brought it to my attention that I didn't know about. So... So you're suggesting it would be possible to FOIA CIRPL documents? Hmm. You know, people have tried. I know there is one document that DIA released to Bill Ryan, who he was one of the... Administrators. Administrator that had information about CIRPL, but it was heavily redacted.
(2:42:36)</p>
<p>Actually, it was not about CIRPL, it was about Project Crystal Night, because that was the project. I remember. It had nothing to do with CIRPL. The document pertained to Crystal Night, and it was a space program being run by the National Security Agency. And but the document was really heavily redacted, so you couldn't really make a whole lot out of it.
(2:43:09)</p>
<hr>
<p>So that's the only thing that I can remember anybody getting from the CIRPL story was Bill Ryan's. And he showed that to me, showed it to other people and wanted to know if I could, you know, maybe read between the lines, but it was too heavily redacted. I just don't know what it was about.
(2:43:39)</p>
<p>Now, I mentioned at the beginning of the show, Project Blue Book being a bona fide disinformation, misinformation campaign. I think history is going to, you know, just continue down that path with it. For you, is that some of the best evidence of the Air Force running misdirection directly with the American public when it came to UFOs?
Oh, yeah, I think initially, it was a program.
(2:44:12)</p>
<p>The reason that they changed, you know, changed names from Grudge, eventually to Blue Book, was that there was different administrators with different objectives. And I know my uncle, Edward Doty, was involved with the Project Blue Book. He was an investigator. And he told me stories about why they changed the name and the differences between an open investigation of something that they can could read readily identify as being an answer to the to a question of what was that in the sky to the more mysterious cases, which they couldn't answer, didn't have an answer to, and how they classified.
(2:45:10)</p>
<p>And so, as you as you said, it's a form of a disinformation campaign, because not one single case, not one single case that the government talked about was identified as a as a legitimate extraterrestrial craft or extraterrestrial contact.
Those cases were classified. They were classified top secret. And they went on to somebody else to investigate. The field investigators only investigated cases of known astronomical objects. And let's face it, most of what the people were seeing could be easily identified as a plane, as a research and development plane, or as the Venus, the planet Venus, or other things.
(2:46:15)</p>
<p>And so, but the ones that couldn't be, they're the ones that that the government's not going to come out public and say, Listen, I got all these cases here, these 700 cases, 701, 701 cases that we can't identify. And every indication is that they're extraterrestrial in nature. They're not going to say that, although that's what they're saying privately, or in the classified documents, that's exactly what they're saying.
(2:46:41)</p>
<p>But they're not going to release that stuff. Okay, and I think that I think that we all understand that. But my point, and thank you for that. But my point to the audience, when we talk about misinformation or disinformation, I have these are direct. I mean, these are things that you can go and research and follow up on your own.
(2:47:12)</p>
<p>And Blue Book and Serpo, certainly, the internet version of Serpo and Martinez and what was going on and all of the players, I don't want to get into the list of names and the aviary and all of that. But it was it was a very concentrated, comprehensive campaign that was in play. It wasn't real. And elements of it possibly being real, but it was misinformation.
(2:47:39)</p>
<p>It was disinformation direct right to the public on the internet. And, and I was I was in the middle of it. Rick, I was right there, man. I was reading those updates every single day. I couldn't wait for you to give some more information to Martinez. Okay. Okay. So, you know what I wish I wish I had the mind to do that.
(2:48:00)</p>
<p>I'd be a millionaire now. I'd be writing science fiction books. Whoever wrote that stuff. That's right. Now you just hit the nail on the head. It was some of the best science fiction ever. Some very creative writers were behind that for sure. Rick Doty being one. So, let's talk about MJ-12. Again, in your opinion, I've already stated mine, misinformation, disinformation campaign out of Washington, D.C.? Yeah, that those documents were created were created at the special means committee within the DIA. Now, some of the information is legitimate.
(2:48:50)</p>
<p>I mean, you can you can verify names and dates and places and you can you can find out who was where and things sure, but but the majority of it was a was a disinformation, I would say. Now, there are other people out there that will say no, but I think that part of that was a disinformation campaign to belittle the UFO community, the people that got it.
(2:49:25)</p>
<p>Okay, okay. You gotta understand who got it.
(2:49:26)</p>
<hr>
<p>Let's go right there. That envelope with the original film role, right? That was sent to Jamie Shandoray here in Burbank. You were involved at that time with William Moore, correct? With Bill Moore. Did you know that that envelope was put in the mail?
No, absolutely not. No, Bill Moore contacted me and said, Jamie got a canister, a film canister that he had developed because he was the photographer, he had his own development studio. And he said, and it contained a classified document. I said, what are you talking about, Bill?
(2:50:19)</p>
<p>And he said, no, no, no, no, tell me. I know it. So I said, well, let me go check and find out.
That's my question. Did you go and check?
Well, I went into the intelligence community and I said, anybody, you know, anybody send Jamie Shandoray some kind of film canister? Is this part of an operation or what? And nobody that within my circle said yes.
(2:50:52)</p>
<p>They said, I don't know. We don't know. It could have happened up in headquarters, but it didn't happen down in the field. So I said, no, Bill, I don't know what you're talking about. And I said, it's probably, you know, Jamie, Jamie exaggerated so much stuff. I mean, I could tell you stories about Jamie that is just ridiculous. But anyways, I said, well, let me fly out there and find out.
(2:51:17)</p>
<p>So I go out there. Well, Jamie, the Jamie didn't want to show it to me. You're talking about you flew to Los Angeles. Yeah. Yeah. I flew to Burbank, John Wayne Airport. Okay. Costa Mesa, I guess the Costa Mesa, right? Yeah. Anyways, I went there and we drove to Jamie's place. And Jamie said, well, I'm not really sure if I should show it to you because I got it.
(2:51:46)</p>
<p>I said, well, Jamie, if you want me to verify what this is. And then I started thinking that Jamie just bullshitting us. And so finally, Jamie, you know, went in and he had it in a secret place. He brings it out, shows it to me. And I look at it. I said, wow, this is something else. I said, I don't know if it's real or not.
(2:52:14)</p>
<p>I mean, I know some of it sounds legitimate, but I don't know all of it, if all of it is. I said, why don't you let me take it? And no, no, no, no, no, no, no, you can't take it. I said, you know what, Jamie, I'm still a federal agent. I could seize this from you because it's classified.
(2:52:32)</p>
<p>It has top secret on it. I said, you don't have the right to know it, Jamie. And he said, okay, okay, okay, okay. You can take it, but let me make a copy. I said, no, you're not going to make any copies of it. So, I take it. I go back to Kirtland. I make a copy. Because it was top secret, I couriered it.
(2:52:59)</p>
<p>All top secret documents back in those days had to be transmitted by the Armed Forces Courier Service. So, you know, I scheduled that. They come and get it, you know, handcuff on wrist and a briefcase and one of those things and they took it up there. Well, about four or five days later, a colonel called me and said, why did you send this up to, back to us? I said, well, I got it from you.
(2:53:23)</p>
<p>Okay. So, that was the source. Bingo. Right. The Pentagon. I said, yeah, it was OSI. It's called a special, yeah, it's a, no, it's a DIA. Okay. Special means committee. Special means committee.
(2:53:44)</p>
<hr>
<p>Now, the special means committee, I knew they created bogus documents. Most of them went to Soviet Union, Chinese intelligence operations. And I said, they said, why did you send it back?
I said, because I got it from a guy in California who somebody mailed it to him. He said, leave it at that, Mr. Doty, just leave it at that. I said, you want me to give it back to him?
(2:54:12)</p>
<p>Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. How, so, you, you returned, Jamie didn't make copies. Jamie Shandoray, everybody's a producer, back here in Hollywood, back in the day, and he worked with Bill Moore. And so, that's who Jamie Shandoray is. So, he didn't make any copies. You took the originals of that. But what about the film role? So, Jamie still had that, right?
No, I took everything. I took everything.
(2:54:44)</p>
<p>Oh, you took everything. Okay. So, you returned that to Jamie?
I did exactly what I was told to do. I took it all the way back. Actually, what I did was I met, I met Jamie and Bill in Prescott, Arizona. And I turned everything over to them. I said, you know, Jamie, I guess you're supposed to have this.
(2:55:11)</p>
<p>And then Jamie mentioned a person who was another agent, but in California, out of Norton Air Force Base, which is a Riverside area. And I said, oh, you know him? His first name is Steve. And Jamie said, yes, I'm working with Steve. I said, okay, I'm out of it. And that's the chain of events. Now, it went a long ways after that, because Bill Moore got a hold of it.
(2:55:42)</p>
<p>And then Bill tried to verify it. And then... Stan Freedman gets involved.
Freedman. Yeah. Well, Stan Freedman, I was at a... I can't remember what I was doing.
Anyways, I was in Houston, Texas. And Stan Freedman was there. And he was talking to somebody.
I can't remember. He had an interview with somebody. No, not Houston, Austin. He had an interview with Bobby Inman and intelligence. He was DIA at the time. And Stan had a copy of it.
(2:56:20)</p>
<p>Stan says, I want to show you something. He goes back to his hotel room. He had it in a sealed area and he pulls it out. He said, did you ever see this? I said, matter of fact, I have.
So anyways, and it went around from there.
It's a difficult thing for the UFO community.
(2:56:48)</p>
<p>There are so many smart people and so many researchers that analyzed every single, not only word, letter, down to the letter, typefaces, the way documents were prepared, how addresses were done, how things were signed.
And you have to do that kind of analysis. And I think that the overarching, including my own eyeballs on this stuff, was that this stuff is really good.
(2:57:25)</p>
<p>So there was a team that was really good at creating authentic documents. You have to have a period typewriter, right? You're not doing this in... well, back then it was done before computers were creating documents. So you had to sit and type this stuff out page for page and have it correct. And then you have to have the data inside of it.
(2:57:55)</p>
<p>If somebody is writing something on a specific date and their name is on it from this address, you have to make sure that that person was in that city at that time, right? And for the most part, everything lined up in the MJ-12 documents. When you were vetting specific things that you could vet, you can't vet E.T., but you can vet the person, their title, and where they were working at that time.
(2:58:24)</p>
<p>And it all lined up. Well, that's because it was a legitimate government document created by the government. But that's the document. Now you have to talk about the information contained in the document. Now, is all that real? Did all that happen?
(2:58:40)</p>
<hr>
<p>That's the question. The document itself is legitimate because the government created it, but they created it for a reason. I mean, I know people out there say, no, it's, you know, this isn't right and this isn't right. Well, they just shot themselves in the foot.
They showed their ignorance because it is a government document. They created a document and they created it for a reason. Now, is it disinformation? I didn't create the document.
(2:59:11)</p>
<p>I don't know the reason. I don't know what they were trying to do with Jamie. I mean, but if you know the background of Jamie, you know, Jamie goes way back. I mean, Jamie was involved with the Navy, Navy Intelligence. He did, he was a source on some things for Navy Intelligence. And he created some things and he did some things that Navy Intelligence told him to do.
(2:59:40)</p>
<p>And he, you know, and then he went off the deep end and, you know, claiming that the Navy SEALs abducted him and all this stuff. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Some things have really got pretty stretched out there. And we're, I've got 30 seconds left. So I will take this time to say amazing conversation tonight, Rick. Amazing. And thank you so much for taking the time from the secret location of the Red Roof Inn somewhere in the Mojave Desert. Thank you so much, Rick. And we'll talk to you around the week. Behave and be well. And thank you.
(3:00:22)</p>
<p>Thank you. Thank you, Jamie. I always enjoy being on your show.
You're the best. Thank you so much, Rick. Okay. And with that, I've got to go straight to the credits. Lots of stuff tonight on the show. Lots. And I know that all of you are going to go back and, and listen to this again.
(3:00:46)</p>

<p>1980年代に次の体験が起きた。</p>
<p>ある夜、完全に自覚した意識状態で目覚めたら、私のアストラル体が体から上空へと抜けだしており、周囲の風景が見えた。彼方には小さな金属製の空飛ぶ円盤が見えていた。</p>
<p>私はその UFO の方へ飛んでいき、UFO の中に入り込んだ。中の様子がはっきりと見えた。真ん中の円形の部屋には人間のような姿をしたのが 2人いた。彼らは人間そっくりで、 UFO を制御していた。部屋の周囲をとりまく壁の棚には計器が取り付けられていた。</p>

<p>上の図は OBE 中の観察に基づいたものらしいが、ソース記事には明確な言及がない。</p>
<p>OBE で UFO の内部を訪れた…とか、リモート・ビューイング（遠隔視）で UFO の内部を観察した…という事例はこれまでも 5～6件は読んだ記憶がある。有名どころとしては Robert Monroe（ロバート・モンロー）の共同実験者の著書に書かれていた事例や Courtney Brown（The Farsight Institue のコートニー・ブラウン）、軍での事例もあったはず。</p>
<p>どの事例も証拠能力は皆無。Courtney Brown のチームの遠隔視の事例には UFO の中に釈尊が座っているのが見えた、というので笑った。</p>

<p>ジョンは続けた： モンスター・ハンティングについて私が知っていることのひとつは、それを実践している人たちは、「ドク 」が『サイキック・バックラッシュ』と呼んでいるものに影響されやすいということだ。これは不可解で恐ろしい不運の連続であり、怪物のような真実を追い求める不運な求道者を目標に向かう途中で襲うことがある。拙著『The Owlman and Others』を執筆していた数ヶ月の間に、ペットの猫2匹が急死し、コンピューター2台が爆発し（車2台も）、妻に先立たれるまでは信じていなかった」。ジョンがオウルマン研究から手を引こうと決めたのも当然だろう。彼は今日に至るまで、このテーマを避けている。</p>

I never believed in it until, during the months that I was working on my book The Owlman and Others, two of my pet cats died suddenly, two computers blew up (as did two cars) and my wife left me.” It’s no surprise that Jon decided to walk away from his Owlman research.

<p>ユリに会って、彼の行動を見た人たちと話したことがあるんだ。そのうちの一人がニューヨークにいたハリー・ベライルだった。ニューヨークにいたとき、彼のオフィスに入ったことがあるんだけど、彼はUFOアップデートの編集者兼発行人だった。彼は『UFOアップデート』の編集者兼発行人だった。
(1:02:17)</p>
<p>でも、ユリ・ゲラーの話になり、彼はあるとき彼のオフィスを突然訪ねたと言った。そして彼の机の上に動くものがあった。それは、彼の掲示板にある、小さなピンが飛び出すようなものだった。そして彼は言った、彼は植え付けをする機会がなかったと。
(1:02:44)</p>
<p>彼が来るのは初めてだった。そして突然、彼はそこに立っていて、いろいろなことが始まったんだ。だから彼はかなり感動していたよ。それから、海軍科学者でゲラーを研究していたエルドン・バードにインタビューしたんだ。彼はゲラーと一緒に仕事をしていた。彼らはしばらく文通をしていて、ゲラーはこれから起こることを彼に話していた。
(1:03:09)</p>
<p>イスラエルの諜報機関がゲラーに協力していて、ゲラーに質問したり、ゲラーに何かをさせようとしたりしていたんだ。それで彼はバードに電話で、こういうことが起こるから気をつけろ、と言ったんだ。そしてその多くは、もちろんこの本に書かれていることだが、実現した。
(1:03:28)</p>
<p>私が一番興味を持ったのは、彼がサイコキネシスだけでなく、ゲラーとのテレパシーにも取り組んでいたことです。そしてゲラーは、彼がゲラーの前にいるとき、彼を何らかの形で充電していた。
(1:03:46)</p>
<hr>
<p>科学者である彼は突然、ゲラーから心的イメージを受け取り、それを彼に送信することができるようになった。それはまるで、緑のメンタル・フィールドのようだった。そしてその後、彼は当時の妻のもとに帰り、二人でそれを行った。そして同じことが起こった。しかし翌日には、彼はその能力を失っていた。
(1:04:16)</p>
<p>しかし、ゲラーと一緒に仕事をしたからこそ、このようなことが起こったのだと彼は言った。それから、彼はイギリスにいて、ゲラーと、たぶん他の人たちと一緒に、あちこちを回っていたそうだ。
(1:04:43)</p>
<p>すると突然、大勢の人たちやスタッフが出てきて、ああ、お会いできて嬉しいです。デモンストレーションをお願いできますか？ゲラーは、はい、はい、と答えた。
そのうちの一人が中に入って大きなナイフを手にした。エルドン・バードに聞いたんだけど、ゲラーは指の一本でナイフに触れただけだったそうだ。
(1:05:03)</p>
<p>そして彼は、私が見ているとナイフが曲がり始めたと言った。そして彼は指を離したが、ナイフは曲がり続けた。
ビリー・グラハムのような人にテレビに出てもらい、君が今したことをやってもらうことだ。そうすれば世界は納得するだろう
そしてゲラーは、いや、もし私が本当にこんなことをできるとみんなが信じたら、私の人生には5セントたりとも価値はないだろう、というようなことを言ったそうだ。
(1:05:42)</p>
<p>彼は、今のままがいいんだ、と言った。なぜなら、私には知的な、ほら、彼には彼を影で支え、彼の能力を使いたがっている諜報部員がいたからだ。そして、彼は自分の能力を持て余すようになっていたんだ。そうだね。すごいね。でも、確かに彼は魅力的なキャラクターだよ。さっきも言ったように、長い間、彼をどう評価したらいいのか分からなかったんだ。
(1:06:04)</p>
<p>でも、彼について知れば知るほど、彼はかなり研究されていることがわかったし、ライブやそういうことをやっているときは、多少トリックを使っているとしても、本物だと思えるんだ。でも、さっきも言ったように、そうしないと大失敗するような気がするんだ。大舞台で何かをするときは、失敗は許されないんだ。そうだね。キット・グリーンが言ったことかもしれないけれど、誰かが言ったんだ。
(1:06:51)</p>
<p>そして彼は言ったんだ、彼は僕らと一緒に一度だけそれを試したことがあるんだけど、それはとても、とてもひどい出来で、誰も騙せなかっただろうって。彼は言った。
彼はある能力も持っていて、私たちの研究でやったようなことは、実際にその能力を持っていなければできるはずがないと言っていました。
(1:07:12)</p>
<p>そして私は、研究において彼をそれほど疑っていない。彼をステージに立たせたとき、私は彼を疑うんだ。そうだね。でも、とにかく、彼がハリー・ベライルのオフィスに入ってきて、いろいろなことが起こったときに、私もそのオフィスにいたかった。

<details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary>▼文字起こし 原文 展開</summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><p>And I think somewhere between Geller and perhaps Ingo Swann, they're the reason why. And they even got Vallee to come on board. I mean, I found this out from Vallee some years back. I had no idea, but he said that they were so perplexed by so many of the remote viewers they were using, telling about how they had UFO encounters that they thought, well, they asked Vallee to come on board on a confidential basis at first to go ahead and talk to these people, see if this was somehow a component of the situation, which they're still trying to figure out to this day.
(1:00:43)</p><p>Yeah, yeah. And I think a lot of people are familiar with Geller because of the TV shows.
I know that's how I first heard of him, when he would do the TV shows, you know, demonstrating his psychic abilities. You'd have Randy on there debunking everything he did.
And at the time, I mean, when I looked at that, I figured if you're performing on TV, you're probably faking it, you know, at least to some degree, because you don't want to fail on live television.
(1:01:18)</p><p>And this stuff is notoriously, you know, difficult to put in that sort of performance space. But I also found it, you know, it bugged me when the amazing Randy would sit there and say, well, look, I can duplicate what he's doing with sleight of hand. And I'm like, but that doesn't prove that what Geller's doing is using sleight of hand.
(1:01:35)</p><p>You know, it's the analogy I always use is just because you can watch a movie and you find out, oh, those punches in that movie are fake. It doesn't mean all punches in real life are fake, you know?
Right. And I, you know, I've talked with people who met Uri and saw him doing things. And I know there was one of them was Harry Belisle, who was in New York City. I walked into his office when I was in New York once, and he was the editor and publisher of UFO Update. And it was a psychic magazine that he published whose name escapes me at the moment.
(1:02:17)</p><p>But we got talking about Uri Geller and he said he made a surprise visit to his office one time. And there was something on his desk that moved. And it was like these, on his bulletin board, there were these little pins that started popping off. And he said now, he said he had no opportunity to have planted, you know, got this place prepared because he had never been to his office before.
(1:02:44)</p><p>This was the first time he'd ever come. And suddenly, you know, he's standing there and all this stuff starts going on. So he was pretty impressed. And then I did an interview with Eldon Byrd, who was a naval scientist and studied Geller. And, you know, he worked with Geller. They corresponded for a while and Geller would tell him things that were going to happen.
(1:03:09)</p><p>And, you know, that the Israeli intelligence was working with him and they would question him and have him try to have him do things. And so he'd tell Byrd on the phone, you know, watch for such and such to happen, you know. And a lot of this, you know, and this is in this book here, of course, came to pass.
(1:03:28)</p><p>What interested me most was how he was, you know, not only working on the psychokinesis, but telepathy with Geller. And Geller sort of, when he was in Geller's presence, he sort of charged him up somehow.
(1:03:46)</p><hr><p>He suddenly himself, as a scientist, was capable of receiving mental images from Geller and then transmitting them to him. And it was like, you know, a green mental field. And so then he went home to his wife at the time afterwards, and they did it. And the same thing occurred. But by the next day, he had lost this ability.
(1:04:16)</p><p>But it was because of working with Geller, he said, that this occurred. And then he said he was over in England, and they were going around, he was with Geller and I think some other people, and they stopped at a little cafe, street cafe, and one of the waiters recognized Geller and went in.
(1:04:43)</p><p>And suddenly a whole bunch of people, staff came out, you know, oh, so good to meet you. And can you give a demonstration? And Geller says, yes, yes.
And so one of them goes in and gets a big knife. And Eldon Byrd told me that, because I interviewed him about this, and he said that Geller just touched it with one of his fingers.
(1:05:03)</p><p>And he said, as I watched it, the knife began to bend. And then he took his finger away, and it continued to bend.
And he says, he grabbed Geller after that and says, what you need to do is get somebody like Billy Graham to go on TV with you and do what you just did. And the world will be convinced.
And he said that Geller told him something like, no, then my life wouldn't be worth a plug nickel if everybody believed I could really do this.
(1:05:42)</p><p>He said, it's better the way it is, you know, because he said, I have intelligent, you know, he had intelligence people who were shadowing him and wanting to use his ability. And he was getting to the point where he just had too much. Yeah. Wow. But yeah, he's definitely a fascinating character. And like I said, for a long time, I never knew what to make of him.
(1:06:04)</p><p>But the more I learned about him, the more I realized that he was studied pretty heavily and, you know, seems to be the real thing, even if he is using some trickery when he's doing live shows and things like that. But like I said, I feel like if you don't, you're setting yourself up for major failure. You know, like you got to make sure those, you know, when you're doing something on a big stage, it can't fail, you know? Yeah. And I remember reading about how, and it might have been Kit Green that had said this, but somebody says, you know that Geller fakes stuff.
(1:06:51)</p><p>And he said, well, he did try that with us one time and it was so, it was so badly done, it wouldn't have fooled anybody. He said, you know, we caught it right off.
Uh, he also has an ability and he said it's, you know, there was no way he could have performed some of the things that he did in our studies, unless he actually had those abilities.
(1:07:12)</p><p>And I'm sure, I don't doubt him so much in the studies. I doubt him when you, when you put him on the stage, you know? Yeah. But, uh, anyway, he, um, I would love to have, you know, had like been in that office of Harry Belisle when he was, uh, walked in and all these things were happening, but that must've been quite something.
(1:07:39)</p><p>Uh, one of the things you talk about in the book that somehow I've missed from Valet is the idea of an associative universe. Do you want to explain that a little bit?
(1:07:48)</p><hr><p>Well, from what I had gathered, you know, he said it was very similar to, uh, the way a computer retrieves information by an association key or something, some keyword or code. And, um, that remote viewing and precognition, um, all this quantum physics stuff, I guess, you know, spooky action at a distance, all that stuff may happen in a similar, similar way.
(1:08:22)</p><p>And, um, so I guess it's something like that. Um, Hmm. And, uh, like information is interconnected.
Yeah. And of course he, he helped the remote viewing people by coming up with, uh, you know, using coordinates to various things, different, different sites. Um, and that way it wouldn't, uh, give away any, um, any information or clues to the, to the remote viewer, what the target was, unless they had all this memorized, what the coordinates were.

<p>Brent Raynes も  Uri Geller は TV 番組の中では時にイカサマをしていたと語っている。 Uri Geller の超常能力を認める他の研究者もそれを認めている。どんな状況でも常に超常能力が 100%発揮できるわけではないのに、TV 番組では失敗が許されない。だからイカサマを用いることもあったのだと。</p>

<p>あなたが話していた中で、私は全く知らなかったのですが、ゼンドラというものがありますね。そう。ジョセフ・ブルックスはLAでERの医師をしていて、彼はフリーとCCRIで働く医学博士なんだ。
(1:09:37)</p>
<p>そして彼は、CE5の実験に何年も深く関わってきた。そして彼は、カリフォルニアのミッション・ラマ・グループが、数年前に、私の本に書かれているのと同じような、とても壮大な出来事を経験した、と教えてくれました。
(1:10:23)</p>
<p>チリでは、青い弧のような光が地面すれすれに現れ、24人ほどがその下を歩いたと報告されています。そして、何人かは、不正なボールヘッドの人型のようなものを見た。そして、そばにいた何人かの人々は、その下を歩いていた何人かが透明になるのを見た。そのような話がいくつもありました。

<p>私はこの地域のテリトリーや動物に精通しているし、私がその存在を知らなかった動物も何度か見てきた。
ブラッドショー夫妻は、あまりに多くの説明のつかない映像を撮影し始めたので、国際的に有名な作家でUFO研究家のトム・ドンゴを呼んだ。彼はこの地域の超常現象についての本を共同執筆している。
私はカメラを取り出して何枚か写真を撮った。どの方向から撮っても同じようなものが撮れたが、違うものだった。
(0:40:36)</p>
<p>私が撮ったものは、リンダが撮ったものとは違っていた。
リンダが撮影した奇妙な写真は、彼女には空に巨大な映画スクリーンがあるように見えた。
空に巨大で輝かしい光が現れた。それは八角形だった。
私は2フレーム撮った。
私の目には光しか見えなかったが、写真を手に取ると、そこには別の場所が写っていた。
(0:41:03)</p>
<p>空を飛ぶ船が写っていた。
電柱、ここには電柱はない。
ほとんど海の岸辺のように見える。
そして左端にはヒューマノイドがいた。
私たちはこれが、ここに別の次元があることを示していると感じている。
つながりがある。開きがある。
ボブとリンダの招待で、私たちは自分の目で確かめるためにブラッドショー牧場にカメラクルーを派遣した。

The Bradshaws started capturing so many unexplainable images, they called in internationally known author and UFO researcher Tom Dongo. He's co-written a book about the paranormal activity of the area.
I got my camera out and took some photographs, random photographs in any direction, and I got some of the same sort of thing, but different.

Linda shot a strange photograph that appeared to her to be an enormous movie screen in the sky.
A huge, brilliant light showed up in the sky. It was octangular.
I got two frames before it flicked back out again.
All I could see with my eye was the light, but when I picked up the photograph, there was a picture of another place.

Telephone pole, there are no telephone poles here.
It almost looks like it might be on the shore of an ocean.
And there was a humanoid in the far left corner.
We feel that this is indicative of showing us that there is another dimension right here.
There is a connection. There is an opening.
On Bob and Linda's invitation, we sent a camera crew to Bradshaw Ranch to see for ourselves.

<p>Bradshaw Ranch で目撃、撮影された UFO は全て現場地下に特有の結晶性鉱物が発生させた EMF 異常による orb だ…と私は判断している。</p>
<p>だが、その判断をこの UFO 写真は反証しているかのように見える。なので、この UFO 写真を吟味してみた。</p>

<p>Linda Bradshaw が撮影したという UFO 写真は、雑誌（確か Time 誌）に掲載された McMinnville UFO 事件の写真の一部を接写したもの。TV 画面からの接写かもしれない。</p>
<p>つまり、上述の UFO 写真は Linda Bradshaw が故意に捏造したもの。同時に ET を目撃したという話も捏造。</p>
<p>なお、Bradshaw Ranch での orb 目撃は第三者による多数の証言や動画映像もあるので事実と見て良い筈。Linda Bradshaw は、ちやほやされてつい UFO 写真を捏造してしまったのだろう。</p>
<p>誰かこの捏造に気づいている筈だと思って、ざっと検索したが Linda Bradshaw の UFO 写真が捏造だという指摘は見当たらないようだ。古い TV 番組が情報ソースなことも影響しているのだろう。</p>

<p>私の楽しみの一つは Scott Adams のようなずば抜けて非凡な人物を Blog や Youtube で見つけること。</p>
<p>昨日、Youtube で見つけた非凡な人物が Yuval Noah Harari で、イスラエルの歴史学者。こういう歴史学者は見たことがない。</p>
<p>その Yuval Noah Harari の並外れた洞察力がよくわかるラジオ・インタビューを紹介する。</p>
<p>Yuval Noah Harari の発言の一部には Ray Kurzweil のソレに近いものがあるが、洞察力においても知性の広がりにおいても Ray Kurzweil は全く比較にならない。Yuval Noah Harari はドグマをドグマとして捉え、盲信していない。</p>
<p>なお、別の動画で彼はゲイだと告白していた。</p>
<p>以下、メモ書き。（このメモ書きでは彼の洞察の凄まじさが全く伝わらない。出がらしですらない。読み返してみて自分の文章表現力（＋表現意欲）の無さを実感w。実際に下の動画の発言を聴かなければ、凄さが伝わない筈。）</p>

<p>5:30 かつての意味の戦争は消えた。</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>9:00 40億年間、有機体生命が発展してきた。現在、市場初めて非有機体の AI による生命が生まれようとしている。</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>10:00 古代のヘブライ人が神に期待した能力（…）を既に現代科学は超えた。</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>12:00 21世紀の最大のマーケットは「永遠の若さ」になる。</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>13:00 シリコン・バレーが目指しているのは…。永遠に生きられる薬ではない。この先、10年先も健康で過ごせるようになる薬。10年ごとに更新。</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>14:00 金持ちは貧乏人よりも身心ともに快適な状態を保つようになる。一端、そうなればそのギャップは解消不能。なぜなら貧乏人はもう太刀打ちできないから。</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>18:00 AI に仕事を取られて、役立たずの階級の人間が大量に生まれる。彼らは経済的にも政治的にもパワーをもたない。</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>18:20 知性が意識と分離するという危険がある。知性は問題を解決する能力。意識は感知する能力。つまり主観的な体験をするのが意識。</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>19:00 SF作品などでは先進的 AI が自動的に意識（感情、欲望など）を持つと見なしている。だが、現段階でそれは起きていない。</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>19:50 過去 60～70年間に AI の知性は劇的に発展した。だが AI の意識の発展はゼロだ。1940年代のコンピュータは意識も感情も持っていなかった。そして現代のコンピュータも同じく意識や感情を持たない。</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>この傾向が続き、将来のコンピュータも意識を持たないままでありうる。将来の AI が超知性を持ちながら、完全に意識を欠如しているものでありうる。</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>21:00 銀河系のほとんどの知性が意識を持たないかも。</p>
</li>

<p>27:00 ヒューマニズムの核は…。人間は意味を放棄して代わりにパワーを得る。具体的には…</p>
<ul>
<li>だが、これはもはや幻想だと判明した。</li>

<p>30:00 Humans aren't individuals, they are dividuals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>30:40 150年間に及ぶ生物学の研究結果の結論はを要約すると…。</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>organisms are algorithms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ヒヒがライオンとバナナの環境で。アルゴリズム、計算結果は感情として。食欲が勝つか、恐怖心が勝つか。つまり感情は神から与えられたスピリチュアルなものではない。感情は生化学的な計算結果だ。</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>34:00 self(自我)というものは無い。人間は他の動物と同じく、生化学的なプロセスの集合体でしかない。</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>34:00 あたりのオハナシが精神世界のソレと完全に同型。</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>36:00 個人も幻想に支配されている。個人は自己に関する虚構の物語を構築し、それに強烈に固着する。その自己の物語が彼の人生を支配する。この自己の物語は要するに幻想だが、とても強力に作用する。人類社会全体も全く同様（神、天国、国家などなど）。</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>36:20 個人の内側にあって人格を統合する自己が存在するという見解も幻想。individual も幻想であって、実体は dividuals の集合だ。</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>37:00 私は本当の自分を知るために毎日 2時間、 Vipassana 瞑想を続けている。先に述べたことは現代の科学のドグマだ。科学が説明し損ねているものが一つある。それは意識だ。どうやて数十億のニューロンが愛や嫌悪、喜び、苦しみを生み出すのか？　我々はこれについては完全に無知だ。</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>38:00 だからと言って過去の宗教的ドグマに戻ることはできない。さらに研究を続ける必要がある。</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>40:00 今の人類は 200年先には存在していないだろう。upgrade human --&gt; super human</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>41:50 従来の技術は外界（環境、社会、経済）を変化させるものだった。だが、今後は人間の体、脳を変化させるものになる。</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>44:00 21世紀には新たなイデオロギー、宗教が生まれる筈。19世紀に社会主義が生まれたように。</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>44:40 その兆候として今、data-izm （データ主義）が主導権をにぎりつつある。</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>45:00 昔は雲（cloud）の上の神が権威だった。近代はその権威が雲から個々人に降りてきた（個人主義、リベラリズム…）。これからは権威が再び cloud に戻るだろう。ただし Google などの cloud（クラウド）だ。</p>

<p>彼の洞察力の凄まじさには感動したが、私は彼の主張には同意しない。</p>
<p>彼の主張に同意できないが、彼の主張には洞察と説得力があることを認めざるをえない。それが私を含む典型的な凡人の反応。凡人連中にそういう反応を引き起こさせる…それこそが彼の非凡さの証。</p>
<p>同様のパターンは Scott Adams （非凡）の発言を聞いた Sam Harris （凡人）の反応でも見られた。Sam Harris は決してナミの凡人ではないが、Scott Adams と対面した時にその知性の格差が露呈した。</p>
<p>この格差の状況を喩えると…。何かの集まりで、一人の「かわいい娘」のまわりに男どもが群がってチヤホヤしている。その場にトップ・モデルのようなゴージャスな美人が登場。一瞬で先の かわいい娘 の男どもの間での市場価値が暴落…w</p>

Humans are always on the lookout for something better, bigger, tastier.
Yuval Harari is a celebrated thinker.
His book Sapiens, about the history of our species, was an international sensation.
It was translated into 30 languages, including English, which allowed me to talk to him here at Ideas. Now he's back with another big picture book, and in it he looks towards the future of humanity.
(0:00:41)</p><p>When humankind possesses enormous new powers, and when the threat of famine, plagues and war is finally lifted, what will we do with ourselves?
What will the scientists, investors, bankers and presidents do all day?
Write poetry?
If we're actually on the verge of eliminating famine, plagues and war, as Yuval Harari says we are, then where does that leave us?
Humanity's next targets are likely to be immortality, happiness and divinity.
(0:01:13)</p><p>Having reduced mortality from starvation, disease and violence, we will now aim to overcome old age and even death itself.
And having raised humanity above the beastly level of survival struggles, we will now aim to upgrade humans into gods and turn Homo sapiens into Homo Deus. Homo Deus is the title of Yuval Harari's latest book.
He joined me in our Toronto studio to talk about the future as he sees it, a future where humans become like gods.
(0:01:53)</p><p>Let me tell you, it was a mind-bending experience.
Yuval, famine, plague and war are still very much with us.
What gives you the idea that they're going away?
Well, we still have definitely famine, plague and war around, but far less than in any previous time in history.
Today, for the first time in history, more people die from eating too much than from eating too little.
(0:02:18)</p><p>More people die from old age than infectious diseases.
More people die from killing themselves or suicide than from war and crime and terrorism put together.
And if you look at famine especially, which was the biggest threat to human life for thousands of years, today, actually, there is no longer any natural famine in the world.
There is only political famine.
If people still starve to death in places like Syria or North Korea or Somalia, it's not because of an objective lack of food.
(0:02:54)</p><p>It is because some politician or government or ideology wants them to starve to death.
And I think that given the progress we've accomplished so far, it's not certain, but it's likely that in the 21st century, we'll be able to bring them under our control.
Okay, well, moving from famine to plague, we might not have the Black Death anymore, but we have AIDS. We have malaria. There's cancer. There's new diseases.
(0:03:24)</p><p>I mean, you know, bird flu and Zika. I mean, there's various viruses that are new.
Is disease disappearing? It seems like it's coming.
Disease is changing.
I mean, for most of history, the main threat was infectious diseases and epidemics, which killed up to a third or a half of all children before they reached adulthood, and which every few decades you had something like the Black Death coming and killing maybe a quarter or a third of the entire population.
(0:03:56)</p><p>In the last few decades, the advances in medicine have managed to bring down a mortality of children from infectious diseases to the lowest level ever.
(0:04:09)</p><hr><p>And managed not to completely stop all epidemics, but to avoid a repeat of the Black Death or of the Spanish influenza.
For example, when you had the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, initially, experts feared that this is the beginning of the new Black Death. But within about three months, they managed to bring Ebola under control.
And in the end, Ebola killed 10,000 people, which is a terrible thing.
(0:04:40)</p><p>But it's a completely different story than the Black Death, which killed something like 40 or 50 million people.
Okay, now that's famine, then, and plague, war.
You come from Israel. How can you say that war is going away?
Yes, I mean, again, you just look at the statistics, first of all, for much of history, maybe about 10% of human mortality was because of human violence.
(0:05:03)</p><p>Today, all over the world, globally, it's about just 1%, or maybe a little more than 1%. Especially if you look at places like Canada, statistically, the chances of the average Canadian being killed by, let's say, Al-Qaeda or ISIS is about a thousand times less than the chances of dying from eating too much at McDonald's. And McDonald's is a thousand times more dangerous to the health of our audience than the Islamic State. But you don't hear it in the news because it doesn't make news.
(0:05:40)</p><p>And even more importantly, previously in history, we had periods of peace, but peace always was a temporary situation.
The meaning of peace was the temporary absence of war.
Everybody knew that, let's say, in the Middle Ages, you had peace between the King of England and the King of France. Something might happen that within one year they will go to war against one another.
(0:06:07)</p><p>So peace was just the temporary absence of war.
Today, in most of the world, peace has a completely new meaning.
Peace means the implausibility of war.
It's simply unthinkable that Britain and France will go to war next year.
And this is true not only in Western Europe. This is true in most of the world.
There are exceptions, of course, like the Middle East. But in most of the world, if you think, for example, about South America, you have to be really crazy to think that next year there might be a big war between Brazil and Argentina. There might be a little border incident, but an old-fashioned war with Brazilian armored divisions trying to conquer Buenos Aires and Argentinian airplanes bombing entire cities in Brazil. This is extremely unlikely to happen.
(0:06:59)</p><p>They just don't think along these lines anymore.
Okay. Well, then, if you dismiss with famine and with plague and with war, what you've done is you've replaced them with three other abstract nouns.
Immortality, bliss, and divinity.
That's a pretty big order.
Now, why have you chosen those three?
Well, this is my educated guess of where humanity is headed.
What are the next big projects of humankind?
(0:07:26)</p><p>And you already see it happening.
(0:07:28)</p><hr><p>In Silicon Valley, maybe the hottest word today is immortality.
Equality may be out, but immortality is very much in.
Google just established two or three years ago a subcompany called Calico, whose stated aim is to overcome death.
They say, hey, we've solved search, so now we'll try to solve death.
And they are not the only ones.
You have people like Peter Thiel, who are also saying explicitly that what they want to do is to overcome old age and death.
(0:08:00)</p><p>And similarly, if you think about bliss and even divinity, when I say that humans will try to upgrade themselves into gods in the 21st century, this is not meant as a metaphor.
I mean it literally.
If you think about the old gods of the traditional mythologies, like the Hebrew God, they have certain qualities, not just immortality, but maybe above all, the ability to create life, to design life.
(0:08:26)</p><p>In the book of Genesis, the first thing God does is to create animals and plants and humans according to his wishes.
Now we are in the process of acquiring these divine abilities.
We want to learn how to engineer and produce life.
And it's very likely that in the 21st century, the main products of the economy will no longer be textiles and vehicles and weapons.
(0:08:55)</p><p>They will be bodies and brains and minds.
And I'll say another thing, that we are actually trying to go beyond any of the traditional gods.
Because even if you believe the creationists that say that all life has been created by God, then the only thing God managed to create in four billion years of life on Earth is organic beings.
All the beings that existed on this planet for four billion years, whether amoebas or dinosaurs or giraffes or homo sapiens, they were organic creatures made of organic stuff.
(0:09:32)</p><p>And now we are in the process of creating the first inorganic entities after four billion years of evolution.
It's very likely that within the lifetime of at least some of our listeners, we will manage to create the first inorganic artificial intelligence entities.
It sounds like you're not saying that we're going to be gods. We're going to be super gods. We're going to be gods that create gods.
(0:09:59)</p><p>In a way, yes. I mean, again, if you think about ancient mythology, you read the Bible. The main thing that biblical Judaism was concerned with is agricultural output.
The main thing the ancient Hebrews expected from their God was to provide rain so you'll be able to water your fields and to provide fertility and to provide protection against all kinds of locusts and diseases and things like that.
(0:10:25)</p><p>And today, modern science is already doing much better than the Hebrew God. I mean, with all the insecticides and antibiotics and genetic crops and things like that, already today, what the Hebrews expected from their gods, our scientists are doing better.
If you think religious fanatics with burning eyes and flowing beards are ruthless, just wait and see what elderly retail moguls and aging Hollywood starlets will do when they think the elixir of life is within reach.
(0:11:01)</p><p>Even when science makes significant progress in the war against death, the real battle will shift from the laboratories to the parliaments, courthouses and streets.
(0:11:12)</p><hr><p>Once the scientific efforts are crowned with success, they will trigger bitter political conflicts.
All the wars and conflicts of history might turn out to be but a pale prelude for the real struggle ahead of us, the struggle for eternal youth.
Eternal youth, I want to focus on where you see that actually happening.
I mean, isn't it already underway?
Aren't people who go to the spa and who buy creams, aren't they looking for eternal youth?
(0:11:39)</p><p>Everybody, not everybody, but most people definitely in modern Western societies are obsessed with youth and with eternal youth.
I mean, until now, people knew that there was a limit to what you can do with going to the gym and buying creams and things like that.
But just from an economic perspective, think what an immense market the market for eternal youth is going to be.
(0:12:07)</p><p>I mean, most likely in the 21st century, the biggest market of all will be the market for eternal youth.
Would you personally want to be young forever, to live forever as a young person?
That's a good question.
I mean, a lot of people, when they talk about immortality, they have a distorted vision of what it means that like you take a pill and you live to be a million.
(0:12:33)</p><p>And this is not what the people in Silicon Valley are talking about, like Ray Kurzweil or Peter Thiel. What they have in mind is something far more down to earth that they will come to you and ask you, do you want to live another 10 years in good health?
The vast majority of people will say, yes, I want another 10 years in good health.
(0:12:56)</p><p>And then when these 10 years are over, they'll come again and say, OK, do you want another 10 years?
It's a renewable contract.
And this is what we're talking about.
It's not a one-time pill that makes you live to be a million.
Nobody understands what it means to live to be a million.
Nobody really wants such a thing.
But to extend your life a decade and another decade and another decade in good health, this is something that I think almost everybody would like to do.
(0:13:25)</p><p>Everybody would like it, but who will be able to afford it?
I mean, the way I know that Silicon Valley works, the prices go very high.
But only for the 1% who can actually pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for a pill that might give them 10 more years of life, healthy life.
That's the big question.
At present, it seems likely that it will not be available for everybody and that biotechnology will, for the first time in history, translate economic inequality into biological inequality.
(0:13:57)</p><p>Throughout history, you always had inequality, but it was always social and economic and political.
It wasn't biological.
There wasn't any real difference in physical or mental abilities between the king and the peasant.
But in 50 years or 100 years, it might be possible for the first time to translate economic inequality into biological inequality.
(0:14:22)</p><hr><p>And humankind will basically split into different biological costs.
The rich will enjoy physical and mental abilities, which will really be superior to the poor.
And once such a gap opens, it becomes almost impossible to close it.
Because the poor will no longer be able to compete with the rich.
This is a frightening brave new world.
I mean, you're talking about a possible existence for most of humanity that will be so far below that of the upper echelons that it won't even be recognizable to them.
(0:14:59)</p><p>It should be emphasized that this is not a prophecy.
It's just a possibility.
I mean, everything that the book Homo Deus describes, they are not prophecies.
They are just mapping different possibilities.
And if you don't like some of the possibilities, you can still do something about it.
I don't think that technology is deterministic.
With the same technology, you can create completely different social systems.
(0:15:25)</p><p>If you look back, then you see that with the technology of the Industrial Revolution, trains and electricity and oil and radio, you could create a communist dictatorship, a fascist regime or a liberal democracy.
The trains and the radio did not really tell you what to do with them.
So it's the same with the technologies of the 21st century.
If we just leave it to market forces, then I'm afraid that, yes, market forces will drive these technologies in the direction of the kind of brave new world with biologically different costs.
(0:16:03)</p><p>But we don't have to allow market forces to make the important decisions for us.
There is still some political options to take these developments in a different direction.
I think that's an important thing.
And you said it's not necessarily a prediction of what will happen.
It might actually be a call to arms.
And I want to get you to talk about that a little later.
(0:16:25)</p><p>First, I want to push you back on something I asked you earlier.
I asked if you wanted to live forever as a young person.
You said it was an interesting question.
You didn't answer the question.
Do you want to live forever?
Personally, I definitely don't want to die in the next 10 years.
And I definitely don't want to age very much.
If I can keep my physical and mental faculties as they are, then yes, I'm a good customer for these kinds of developments.
(0:16:52)</p><p>I think it will be dishonest to pretend to be anything else.
I mean, to get another 10 years of good health.
Yeah, sure.
Many scholars try to predict how the world will look in 2100. This is a waste of time.
Any worthwhile prediction must take into account the ability to re-engineer human minds, and this is impossible.
There are many wise answers to the question, what would people with minds like ours do with biotechnology?
(0:17:27)</p><p>All we can say is that people similar to us are likely to use biotechnology to re-engineer their own minds, and our present-day minds cannot grasp what might happen next.
(0:17:39)</p><hr><p>Computers are very much at the center of much of what you're talking about, and some people have used the word transhuman to describe where we're going, a point at which there's some sort of convergence between computer intelligence and human intelligence.
I think Ray Kurzweil, who you mentioned, uses the word synchronicity, that the two will become similar, and in fact, at some point, they will pass.
(0:18:01)</p><p>I'm wondering, how far do you see us going down that road?
I think that artificial intelligence, AI, is now outperforming humans in more and more tasks, and therefore may even push humans out of the job market and will create an immense new class, the useless class.
People who can't do anything better than an AI, better than computers, so they don't have any jobs and any political power.
(0:18:29)</p><p>But looking even further to the future, I think the big danger is that intelligence will simply decouple from consciousness.
A lot of people confuse intelligence with consciousness, because in humans and in all mammals, intelligence and consciousness go together.
Intelligence basically is the ability to solve problems.
Consciousness is the ability to feel things, to have subjective experiences, to feel pain or joy or love or hate or anger or whatever.
(0:19:03)</p><p>Now, we think of one of those being a sort of human territory and one of them being a computer or machine territory.
What do you mean by decoupling? What's an example of them separating?
Well, for millions of years of evolution in mammals and humans, intelligence and consciousness went together because the way mammals solve problem is to a large extent by relying on their feelings, on their sensations and on their emotions.
(0:19:27)</p><p>And because they go together, people often have the idea that they must go together.
And in many science fiction movies, when computers become super intelligent, they automatically also become conscious and they start having emotions and desires and all that.
Now, this is definitely not what is happening now. Computers are not becoming conscious. They're becoming highly intelligent.
Over the last 60 or 70 years, there has been a tremendous progress in computer intelligence, but exactly zero progress in computer consciousness.
(0:20:05)</p><p>Computers in the 1940s had no consciousness, no feelings, and computers today have no consciousness and no feelings.
If we look to the future, this trend may continue and we may see the emergence of a super intelligence, which is completely devoid of consciousness.
And this super intelligence might make all humans powerless and redundant and may even break out of planet Earth because organic beings have been limited to this planet for four billion years because it's very difficult to sustain organic life in outer space or other planets.
(0:20:43)</p><p>But a non organic artificial intelligence will find it much easier to survive space travel and to colonize other planets.
So what we may see is not just on Earth, but in the entire galaxy, the spread of this in very high intelligence, but devoid of consciousness.
(0:21:03)</p><hr><p>And this is a very scary scenario to imagine, not just Earth, but the galaxy full of intelligence and devoid of consciousness, devoid of feelings and emotions.
So in some real sense, natural selection, which Darwin talked about, which we've always thought was the way things were going to move along, is going to be replaced with market selection.
Human beings are going to both be supplying what they want to sell and buying it as well.
(0:21:31)</p><p>Yeah, I mean, the problem is that from the viewpoint of the market, consciousness has no value at all.
But intelligence is what the market really values.
If you think about something like a taxi driver. So up till now, all taxi drivers had consciousness, they had feelings, they had emotions. Why?
Not because we need emotions from taxi drivers, but simply because the only thing intelligent enough to drive a taxi was human being, which came along in this package.
(0:22:04)</p><p>You also got consciousness and emotions. But within a very short time, most experts today estimated within five or 10 years, AI will drive cars better than any human being, not only more cheaply, but far more safely.
Today, every year, about 1.3 million people die each year from car accidents.
That's twice the number of people who die from war and crime and terrorism put together. And almost all these car accidents are caused by human error.
(0:22:39)</p><p>And if you replace humans with algorithms, with AI, you solve most of these errors. And AI, a self-driving car, will never drink alcohol and drive. It will never fall asleep while driving.
It will never disobey traffic signals or a stop sign.
(0:23:14)</p><p>So it's very likely that we will see, because what we need is the intelligence, not the consciousness, we will see that human drivers are being replaced by these computers, by these AI. And the world will be a better place?
From an economic perspective, definitely, yes. But again, the big question is, do we want a situation in which eventually everything is super intelligent, but without consciousness, without emotions, without feelings?
(0:23:33)</p><p>And this is, I think, a very deep philosophical question. And actually, speaking of philosophy, a lot of philosophical questions that for thousands of years were just theoretical riddles for philosophers to pass time may become practical questions in everyday life that engineers need to think about.
Again, going back to these driverless cars, let's say that you have a car, that the car is driving, and it's about to collide, to run over five people. And the only way to save these five people is to swerve to the side, fall off a cliff, and kill the driver.
(0:24:13)</p><p>What should you do? This is the kind of questions that philosophers have been arguing about for thousands of years, and it had very little practical impact, because no matter what you said in theory that you will do, when you are actually in the situation, you did something different.
But now, when you have a driverless car, you need to program the algorithm that drives the car with the answer to these ethical questions.
(0:24:41)</p><p>If a driverless car sees that it's about to run over five pedestrians, and it can swerve to the side, fall off a cliff, and kill its owner, what should it do?
(0:24:51)</p><hr><p>The engineers at Google, they need to program the code. So they need to answer this philosophical question. And the amazing thing is, whatever answer they give, it will actually be implemented.
Now, of course, because we live in a market economy, maybe they will say, let's just leave it to market forces, to the customers.
We'll produce two cars, the Toyota Altraist and the Toyota Egoist. The Toyota Altraist, if you buy it, when in this situation, it will kill you and save the five people.
(0:25:22)</p><p>The Toyota Egoist will save you and kill the other five people. And customers will just decide which car they want to buy. And, you know, the customer is always right.
That's beautiful.
You're listening to Ideas on CBC Radio 1, Sirius XM and cbc.ca slash ideas. We're talking with acclaimed historian Yuval Harari about his book, Homo Deus. The title, of course, translates as Man God, because that's what he believes is happening to our species. We're collectively in the process of becoming like gods, something our ancestors could only imagine in myths and legends.
(0:26:08)</p><p>It's this kind of original intellectual portraiture that has won Yuval Harari a raft of international awards. You can see him on our website, cbc.ca slash ideas. In a short video improvising on terms and ideas, we just kind of threw at him for fun. Here he is now, ruminating on a crucial term he writes about in his book, modernity.
Modernity is a deal. All of us sign up to this deal on the day we are born, and it regulates our lives until the day we die. Very few of us can ever resign or transcend this deal. It shapes our food, our jobs, and our dreams, and it decides where we dwell, whom we love, and how we pass away.
(0:26:55)</p><p>At first sight, modernity looks like an extremely complicated deal. It's like when you download some software and are asked to sign an accompanying contract which is dozens of pages of legalese. You take one look at it, immediately scroll down to the last page, tick I agree, and forget about it.
Yet in fact, modernity is a surprisingly simple deal. The entire contract can be summarized in a single phrase. Humans agree to give up meaning in exchange for power.
(0:27:26)</p><p>Exchanging meaning for power. How does that, in your mind, define the modern era that we live in?
Well, in pre-modern times, people believe that they are part of some cosmic drama, some cosmic play. They have a part to play. They don't have much power. I mean, they must do whatever God decides that they will. This is your part in creation. This is your part in the universe.
(0:27:55)</p><p>So you don't have the power to change your role. But in exchange, you got meaning. Your life really meant something. You're playing maybe a small part, but you're still playing a part in this cosmic drama. And whatever I said, whatever I did, it meant something from a cosmic perspective.
(0:28:16)</p><hr><p>Now, in the modern world, we no longer believe in this cosmic drama. There is no drama. There is no director. There is no screenplay. Nothing. Which means, on the one hand, that everything we do has absolutely no meaning. If planet Earth explodes tomorrow morning with all the people on it, the universe won't care.
On the other hand, because there is no great plan, no drama, so there is no limit on our power. The only limit on our power is our own knowledge or ignorance. If we have the knowledge, then we can completely change our place in the universe, the way we behave, everything. It's up to us to give meaning to the whole universe.
(0:29:01)</p><p>And how will you do it? By looking inside yourself, connecting to your true self, connecting to your feelings, your emotions. Your feelings will give meaning not just to your own life, but to the entire universe. This is the basic message, the basic dogma of humanism, which have dominated the world for the last two or three centuries.
The literal meaning of the word individual is something that cannot be divided. That I am an individual implies that my true self is a holistic entity rather than an assemblage of separate parts.
(0:29:46)</p><p>However, over the last few decades, the life sciences have reached the conclusion that this literal story is pure mythology. The single authentic self is as real as the eternal Christian soul, Santa Claus, and the Easter Bunny. If you look really deep within yourself, the seeming unity that we take for granted dissolves into a cacophony of conflicting voices, none of which is my true self.
(0:30:13)</p><p>Humans aren't individuals. They are dividuals.
Most traditional societies and religions indeed imagined that the way humans make decisions is because they have some spiritual essence called soul or spirit or whatever.
And in the end, in some kind of magical way, with free will or whatever, this magical soul makes decisions.
Now, over the last two centuries, the life sciences have been distancing themselves more and more from this traditional viewpoint.
(0:30:54)</p><p>And you can summarize, I think, 150 years of biological research since Charles Darwin in three words.
Organisms are algorithms. The way that all organisms, whether it's tomatoes or giraffes or homo sapiens, the way we make decisions is not because of some spiritual essence, but in an algorithmic way by biochemical reactions and calculations in our own body.
I've never heard evolution described as an algorithm before, but it makes sense.
(0:31:29)</p><p>Yeah, and I can give maybe a simple example of how it works. Otherwise, it sounds very complicated.
Let's say that you're a baboon in the African savannah and you see not far from you there is a tree with bananas, but also there is a lion nearby.
And this is a typical problem of survival that natural selection puts before organisms.
In order to survive, you need to make the right decision to go for the bananas or not.
(0:31:58)</p><p>This is basically a problem of calculating probabilities. What is the probability that I will starve to death if I don't eat the bananas versus the probability that I will be eaten by the lion if I try to get the bananas?
(0:32:14)</p><hr><p>So to survive and pass my genes on to the next generation, I need to calculate the probabilities correctly.
How does the baboon calculate probabilities? Well, first I need a lot of data. Data about the bananas. How far are the bananas? How many bananas? Are they big or small, ripe or green?
Then I need data about the lion. How far is the lion? Is it big or small? Is he awake or asleep?
(0:32:41)</p><p>And I need a lot of information about myself. How fast I can run, how hungry I am, and things like that.
Now you need to take all this data into account and quickly calculate the right probabilities.
How does the baboon calculate the probabilities? Not with pen and paper or a pocket calculator.
The entire body and nervous system and brain of the baboon is the calculator.
(0:33:06)</p><p>What we call sensations and emotions are the way in which the baboon takes in all the data, makes the calculation, and reaches a conclusion.
The conclusion of the calculation will not appear as a number. It will appear as what we call emotion.
If the probability is positive, you should go for the bananas, then this will appear as the emotion of courage.
The baboon will suddenly feel courageous and he will be puffed up and he will run for the bananas.
(0:33:37)</p><p>And if the calculation is negative, then this will appear as the emotion fear.
So what we call emotions are not some spiritual phenomena that comes from God or whatever. It's biochemical calculations.
And yet, and I don't know what I'm reaching for here, but I'm reaching deep inside myself.
And that's something people do. I mean, you look for the gut instinct. You try to find the honest, physical, almost physiological response.
(0:34:07)</p><p>And I'm still stuck in a world where I want to cling to that and claim there is a self other than something that's just calculating how fast this self can run to get the banana.
Well, most people cling to it, but most biologists say no, there is no self. Humans and other animals are just a collection of biochemical processes that basically calculate probabilities.
(0:34:33)</p><p>And for me, what brought this home, what brought this revolution home was a children's movie I saw this year, a very good one by Disney. I think inside out. Did you see it by any chance? You know, for decades, Disney has been selling kids all over the world.
This humanist fantasy that you are an individual and the right way to make decisions in life is getting touches with yourself.
(0:34:59)</p><p>Listen to yourself, follow your heart, and everything will be okay. And this new film Inside Out, it tells about a girl called Riley, which moves from Minnesota to San Francisco, and she has a crisis.
And then it looks what's happening inside her head. And you find out, and this is what Disney is telling the kids now, this girl Riley, she's just a robot.
(0:35:21)</p><p>Inside her head, you have all these amazing biochemical mechanisms. It shows how dreams are being produced and how emotions are competing with one another.
(0:35:32)</p><hr><p>And there is no self inside. There is no inner voice that Riley needs to get in contact with. There are just biochemical mechanisms that produce all the decisions that Riley makes. And this is Disney. Okay, that's Disney. Let's make it Yuval. Is there a you in Yuval? I mean, you wake up every morning in Israel or when you're in a world tour like this, you have certain assignments.
(0:36:01)</p><p>I'm assuming you go to the bathroom and you wash up. And then if you're at home, you probably go and teach. Here you get ready to go and do interviews with the likes of me.
And you follow a daily routine, which is something that is repeatable. You repeat it. And ultimately you begin, I would assume, to treat that as something like, Oh, that's myself. That's what I do. That's what I am.
(0:36:24)</p><p>What happens is that people construct a story about themselves and they become extremely attached to this story. They identify with this story and it basically controls their life.
Now, this story, it's in truth, it's an illusion. It's a fantasy, but it is still a very, very powerful in the same way that entire human societies are being controlled by fictional stories about God and heaven and the nation and all that.
(0:36:57)</p><p>So also each individual is actually not an individual. It's a collection of internal entities that are being controlled by this belief in a single overarching story, which is in truth fictional.
Now, I do my best to really understand the reality about myself. So I spend two hours every day meditating. I meditate, Vipassana meditation, two hours every day to really understand, go beyond this fictional story and really look, what am I?
(0:37:36)</p><p>What is the body? What is the mind? How are they interacting? And this is a very important part of my life. And one other thing that I would like to comment on this is that I'm not saying that what I just said about there is no self, everything is just biochemical calculations. This is not necessarily the truth.
This is current scientific dogma. There is one thing that this theory so far fails to explain, and this is consciousness, the mind. We don't have any good theory that explains how the brain produces the mind.
(0:38:16)</p><p>How come when billions of neurons in the brain fire electrical signals one to the other, how does this produce a subjective experience of love or hate or pain or joy? We have absolutely no idea.
The scientists, they have kind of a dogma that somehow the neurons produce these experiences and maybe we'll have a good explanation in 20 years or 50 years, but at present we don't. Now, it doesn't mean that the old mythological stories of religions like Christianity about the soul, that they are right because science can't explain consciousness.
(0:38:58)</p><p>I don't think we should go back. We should go forward. We should say, yes, we don't understand consciousness yet, so we need to keep on researching and to invest far more time and energy and money in investigating the mind and not just the brain and the body.
(0:39:17)</p><hr><p>In the early 21st century, the train of progress is again pulling out of the station and this will probably be the last train ever to leave the station called Homo sapiens.
Those who miss this train will never get a second chance. In order to get a seat on it, you need to understand 21st century technology and in particular the powers of biotechnology and computer algorithms.
(0:39:48)</p><p>These powers are far more potent than steam and the telegraph and they will not be used merely for the production of food, textiles, vehicles, and weapons.
The main products of the 21st century will be bodies, brains, and minds.
And the gap between those who know how to engineer bodies and brains and those who do not will be far bigger than the gap between Dickens' Britain and the Mahadi's Sudan. Indeed, it will be bigger than the gap between sapiens and Neanderthals. In the 21st century, those who ride the train of progress will acquire divine abilities of creation and destruction while those left behind will face extinction.
(0:40:32)</p><p>According to what you say in the book, we're all either going to become gods like Shiva or Yahweh or we're going to die. We'll disappear. Is it really that stark?
I think given the current pace of technological development, it's very unlikely that human beings like you and me will continue to exist in, say, 200 years.
We are one of the last generations of homo sapiens.
(0:41:07)</p><p>Given the technological powers that we will have, either we will destroy ourselves or we will upgrade ourselves into something completely different.
Now science is coming and saying we are not there yet, but we are getting closer.
Death is no longer a kind of metaphysical decree.
People have to die because God said so.
No, death is a technical problem.
And every technical problem, at least in principle, has a technical solution.
(0:41:37)</p><p>So we are now working on the technical solution.
And it's the same with upgrading humans.
People dreamt about it for thousands of years.
All the ancient mythologies are full of upgraded superhumans.
But we never had the technology to actually do it.
So it was all just imagination.
It was all just fantasies.
Now, for the first time, we are approaching the point when technology gives us the ability to realize our fantasies.
(0:42:08)</p><p>But up till now, it was mostly the power to change reality outside, to change the world, to change the geography, the economy, the social system.
But the world inside, inside our bodies, inside our brains, this hardly changed at all.
We still have the same bodies, the same brains that we had 20,000 years ago.
In the next century or two, we will direct our gaze from outside inwards and we'll start for the first time in history to really change our bodies and our brains and not just the economy or society.
(0:42:46)</p><p>I was intrigued in the book.
You seem to imply, in fact, suggest that that fundamentalism, religious fundamentalism is on its way out, that it's not something that will last.
(0:42:57)</p><hr><p>Again, it's like war and plague and pestilence.
I look around and I see a lot of people who still believe in God and I don't see that trend necessarily.
Yes, it's basically like in the 19th century with the Industrial Revolution. Most people still believe in God, not in the steam engine.
But what changed the world was the steam engine, not God. And it's happening again. Now, given the tremendous changes we're facing already today in the world, you see a lot of people trying to cling to some eternal story like God or like the nation.
(0:43:32)</p><p>But this is unlikely to really stop the change in the world or to shape the 21st century because these stories don't offer us answers to the big problems of the 21st century.
The big problems of the 21st century are things like what to do when you can start designing babies with biotechnology, what to do when artificial intelligence is pushing humans out of the job market.
(0:44:02)</p><p>And you have this massive useless class.
What to do when humankind is being split into different biological costs.
Now, you don't find answers to any of these questions in the Bible or in the Quran because the people who wrote these books back in ancient times did not know anything about artificial intelligence or about genetics.
So it's obvious they don't have the answers there.
(0:44:29)</p><p>If you need answers, you need to create new ideologies, new religions.
And in the same way that in the 19th century we saw the creation of new ideologies like socialism and they really changed the world.
So I think in the 21st century we'll again see the rise of new ideologies and new religions coming, not from the Middle East, but from places like Silicon Valley. And they will shape our world much more than the fanatics of the Islamic State. Can you be specific about what these new religions you talk about might look like or sound like or be like?
(0:45:08)</p><p>Yes, the most important, I think at least at present, is dataism, a religion or ideology which worships data and not God and not humans.
Basically, what dataism says is that given enough biometric data and given enough computing power, an external algorithm can understand me better than I understand myself.
And once we have such an algorithm, authority will shift away from individual humans to these algorithms.
(0:45:42)</p><p>So in the same way that authority at first was with the gods above the clouds, and then in modern times authority shifted below the clouds to human beings, now authority will shift again back to the clouds, but to the Google cloud, to the Microsoft cloud.
This is where authority in the 21st century will reside.
And all the important decisions will not be made by the Pope or by God. They will not be made by democratic elections and by individual consumers.
(0:46:14)</p><p>They will be made by the algorithms in the cloud.
Techno-humanism agrees that Homo sapiens as we know it has run its historical course and will no longer be relevant in the future.
(0:46:28)</p><hr><p>But concludes that we should therefore use technology in order to create Homo Deus, a much superior human model.
Homo Deus will retain some essential human features, but will also enjoy upgraded physical and mental abilities that will enable it to hold its own even against the most sophisticated non-conscious algorithms.
Since intelligence is decoupling from consciousness, and since non-conscious intelligence is developing at breakneck speed, humans must actively upgrade their minds if they want to stay in the game.
(0:47:03)</p><p>Humanism thought that experiences occur inside us and that we ought to find within ourselves the meaning of all that happens, thereby infusing the entire universe with meaning.
Dataists believe that experiences are valueless if they are not shared, and that we need not, indeed cannot, find meaning within ourselves.
We need only record and connect our experience to the great data flow, and the algorithms will discover its meaning and tell us what to do.
(0:47:37)</p><p>Algorithms telling us what to do may sound like a half-baked notion straight out of second-rate science fiction, but Yuval Harari maintains that we're already getting closer to that reality.
You actually give a musical example, and that's a computer program that was created that actually created a piece of music, and it was given to people to listen to.
And they listened to it, they thought it was real music created by a human being. What does that tell you?
(0:48:08)</p><p>Actually, maybe you can just do an exercise of just, you know, play the Bach and the EMI music and ask the listeners, what do you think was composed by Bach and which one was composed by a computer?
We can do that. In fact, we can find the examples and play them.
I think this will be amazing.
Here's the background.
(0:48:35)</p><p>The musicologist was David Cope, who was at the University of California. He'd invented a computer program called EMI, which could create music.
Then somebody challenged this professor, OK, let's play the piece composed by your computer, and let's play real Bach, and we'll see if people will be able to tell the difference.
So here we go. Can you tell the difference between a computer-generated piece of music and another one made by the real flesh-and-blood Johann Sebastian Bach?
(0:49:08)</p><p>Here's one piece.
And now here's the other.
And the amazing thing is that most listeners thought that the real Bach was composed by a computer and that the computer piece was composed by Bach. For the record, the real Bach piece is this one.
We are flooded with such examples, like just a few months ago, there was this famous match of Go. Go is like Chinese chess.
(0:49:57)</p><p>It's much more complicated than chess.
And most experts before the match were convinced that there is no way that the computer can beat a human champion at Go. And the artificial intelligence AlphaGo actually went on to defeat the human champion Lee Sedol 4 to 1 in a match in Seoul. But the really important thing is that Go experts then analyzed the way in which AlphaGo played.
(0:50:27)</p><p>And they were amazed because nobody told AlphaGo how to play Go. They just told the AI what are the basic rules, what it can do and cannot do.
(0:50:38)</p><hr><p>And then they just left it to AlphaGo. It played, I don't know, millions of times against itself to train itself.
And then it just went on to defeat the human world champion at Go. It gets worse or better depending on your perspective.
You know how various websites like Amazon recommend future purchases for you based on the data the site collects from your past purchases.
(0:51:06)</p><p>That kind of predictive algorithm is just in its infancy.
If you read a book on Kindle, so as you read the book, the book reads you.
Kindle knows which pages you read fast, which pages you read slow and where you stop reading.
It gives you a lot of insight about your reading habits and what you like and dislike.
Now, already today you can even upgrade Kindle with face recognition programs so it can basically monitor and analyze your facial expression and know if you're laughing, if you're crying, if you're bored, if you're angry.
(0:51:44)</p><p>In 5-10 years, you can connect Kindle to biometric sensors inside your body and that constantly monitor your blood pressure, your sugar level, your testosterone level, everything.
And then Kindle will know what is the exact emotional impact of every sentence you read in the book.
Now, most of what you read, you forget very quickly after finishing the book.
But Kindle, which means Amazon, will never forget anything.
(0:52:13)</p><p>It will basically know who you are and how to press your emotional buttons.
As I've said repeatedly throughout the conversation, this is a brave new world that I'm not sure I wanted to be part of.
But it's interesting the way you've described it.
I want to close by posing another question that comes from something you said earlier in the conversation.
You said that we could have a choice between two kinds of cars that would be self-driving cars.
(0:52:39)</p><p>So we wouldn't be driving them ourselves ultimately.
But we could choose to have either a Toyota altruist or a Toyota egoist.
Which one would Yuval drive?
I don't like driving.
So I really look forward to the moment when I can just give it to the algorithms to drive my car.
Other things I like to keep to myself.
I think that the key is to really get to know yourself better.
(0:53:08)</p><p>I mean, if you want to compete against the algorithms, the question is, do you know yourself better than the algorithms know you?
And so, you know, the oldest advice in the book, know yourself, is now becoming far more important than ever before.
Because if you don't know yourself well, then you're very easy prey to these algorithms.
Yuval, thank you very much.
Thank you.

<p>Joe McMoneagle から直接聞いたという話を Tom Dongo が語っている。</p>
<p>それにしても、Dolly Safran が頻繁にタワゴトのくちばしを入れるのがウザい。</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="fasterwhisper-ailarge-v2-model--deepl2024-07-model">FasterWhisper AI(large-v2 model) + DeepL(2024-07 model)<a href="https://ouchaku.github.io/ds/blog/2024/10/15/rv#fasterwhisper-ailarge-v2-model--deepl2024-07-model" class="hash-link" aria-label="FasterWhisper AI(large-v2 model) + DeepL(2024-07 model) への直接リンク" title="FasterWhisper AI(large-v2 model) + DeepL(2024-07 model) への直接リンク">​</a></h2>
<p>さて、ここでNeural Channelsからの質問、あるいはリクエストだ。トム、君がE.T.シップを訪ねたときのリモート・ビューイング体験について話してくれるのを待ちきれないと書いてある。ああ、ぜひやりたい。
今夜、ジョー・マクモニーグルが出演していたよ。
ジョー・マクモニーグル、まだ生きてたんだ。
(1:09:24)</p>
<p>たぶん僕と同い年だ。
すごいな。ジョー・マクモニーグル、彼の隣に立ってたんだ。
もう20年くらい前のことだ。
それでね、このときは自分がおかしくなったんじゃないかと思ったんだ。
こんなことやってられない。
つまり、頭がおかしくなったんだ。
こんなことが本当にあるわけがない。
ジョー・マクモニーグルは僕の隣にいて、肩を並べていた。
(1:09:49)</p>
<p>そして彼はこう話していた。
彼が話しているとき、私は本当に狂っていないんだと言った。
でも彼は、彼と政府のUFO、つまり視聴者がエイリアンクラフトを見に行っていると言ったんだ。
それは簡単だ。
ある講演をしたときに、クラス全員に教えたんだ。
何人かはそれをやった。
ショックを受けた表情で、彼らはそれをやったんだ。
(1:10:22)</p>
<p>だからジョーは、この話をするのが大好きなんだ。
彼はなんてカモだったんだ。
つまり、彼はこう言ったんだ、僕はこの船に行って、君は宇宙に行くんだ。
宇宙船に近づけば、そこにはたくさんのエイリアンがいる。
地球の周回軌道にいるか、交易路にいるかのどちらかだ。
だからジョー、君は宇宙に出て、エイリアンの船を見つけるんだ。
(1:10:51)</p>
<p>ゆっくり近づくんだ。
友好的だと感じたら、そのまま進む。
もし友好的でないと感じたら、素早く逃げるんだ。
彼らは君にちょっかいは出さない。
そのまま近づいていけば、船体のすぐ近くまで来る。
まだいい感じだ。
入って、そのまま突き抜ける。
壁を突き抜けて浮くことができる。
何度もやったよ。
もうやらない。
(1:11:09)</p>
<p>興味がないんだ。
でもジョーはやった。
ジョー・マクモニーグルがやったんだ。
檻に入れられた。ガラスの檻みたいなやつだ。
警告したんだ。
これ以上船に近づくなと警告したんだ。
2、3回は警告したと思う。
それで彼らは彼を出られない檻に入れた。
(1:11:33)</p>
<p>それで彼の精神は宇宙のどこかにあって、体はここにある。
彼は本当に怖くなった。
彼はベトナムにいた。彼はベトナムに2回遠征したと思う。ベトナムではひどい銃撃を受けた。彼の背中にはコンピューターが配線されていて、立ち上がることができるんだ。
それで最終的に釈放されたんだ。
俺は思ったんだ、このバカ、ジョーって。私は決してそんなことはしない。
(1:11:56)</p>
<p>警告されたら逃げろ。
奴らに干渉するな。
(1:12:01)</p>
<hr>
<p>相手が本当にダメージを与えてくる可能性があるから、そのまま行ってはいけない。
とにかく、難しいことじゃない。
本当に難しいことじゃない。想像力を働かせるんだ。
想像力じゃない。
想像じゃない。
じゃあ、やってみて何が見えた？
そうだね、カメラのようにゲージにピントを合わせて見るんだ。
できる人もいるかもしれないけど、僕にはできない。でも、リモート・ビューイングを始めた頃、モスクワの金庫に行って、金庫の中を見て、文書を見つけて、それを読むことはできないことがわかったんだ。
(1:12:44)</p>
<p>今はどこでも、どんなリモート・ビューワーでもできる。
ロシア人ならできる。
1万マイル離れたどこかの金庫に入り、書庫に下りて文書を見つけることができる。
あなたはそれを読むことはできない。
ロシア人ならできる。
我々にもできる。
アメリカ人にもできる。
イギリス人だってそうだ。
だから今、彼らはそれができる。
(1:13:03)</p>
<p>でも、やってみた。
僕にはできない。
でもとにかく、船にはいつも光源があって、それがどこから来ているのかわからない。
ただ照らされている。
柔らかい光で、船には鋭い角がない。
エイリアンの船にはぶつかって怪我をするようなものは何もない。
すべてがスムーズなんだ。
しかし、彼らは船をコントロールする。
(1:13:29)</p>
<p>彼らのほとんどは頭で船をコントロールする。
椅子に座り、このようなヘッドセットをつける。
それが船をコントロールするんだ。
つまり、彼らは手にトラクターを持っているわけではないんだ。
とにかく、これが僕の、難しいことじゃないんだ。
難しいことじゃないけど、僕はもうやらない。
長い間やってきた。
(1:13:50)</p>
<p>ただ、ただ。
だから、君はあそこで見たんだ。
丸みを帯びた壁とか、直接照明とか、全部見ただろ。
そうだ。そうだ。不透明なんだ。
ほとんどクリアじゃない。
僕が投影した場所では、クリアで透明だった。
でも、ほとんどの場合は不透明なんだ。</p>
<details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary>▼展開</summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><p>Well, here's a question from, or a request from Neural Channels. It says, can't wait for you, Tom, to talk about your remote viewing experience when you visited E.T. Shipp. Yes, I want to do this.
Joe McMoneagle was just on tonight.
Joe McMoneagle, I didn't know he was still alive.
(1:09:24)</p><p>He's probably about my age.
Wow. Joe McMoneagle, I was standing right next to him.
This was about 20 years ago now.
And, you know, this time I thought I was going insane.
I can't be doing this stuff.
I mean, you know, I've got to be nuts.
I mean, there's just no way this is for real.
And so Joe McMoneagle, he was right beside me, shoulder to shoulder.
(1:09:49)</p><p>And he was talking about, and I'd been doing this.
And when he's talking, I said, I'm really not crazy.
But he said him and the government UFO, I mean, viewers were going on alien craft.
And it's easy.
I taught a whole class to do it when I was doing one of my speaking gigs.
And so the shock, some of them did it.
And you could tell the shock expression on their face, they did it.
(1:10:22)</p><p>So Joe, I love to tell this story.
What a sucker he was.
I mean, you know, he said, well, I went to this ship and you go into space.
If you get close to an alien craft, there's lots of them out there.
They're either in orbit around the earth or on a trade route.
So Joe, you go out into space and you find an alien ship.
(1:10:51)</p><p>You go up to it slow.
If it feels friendly, keep going.
And if it doesn't, get away fast.
They don't mess around with you.
So if you keep going closer, you're right up to the hull of the ship.
It still feels good.
Go in, just go right through.
You can float right through the wall.
I've done it many times.
I don't do it anymore.
(1:11:09)</p><p>I'm just not interested in it.
But Joe did.
Joe McMonagle did that.
And they grabbed him and put him in a cage, like a glass cage, and wouldn't let him go.
Oh, they warned him.
He said, we warned you not to come any closer to this ship.
I think two or three times they warned him.
And so they put him in a cage he couldn't get out of.
(1:11:33)</p><p>So his psyche is up there in space somewhere and his body is down here.
He really got scared.
And he was in Vietnam. I think he did two tours in Vietnam. He got shot up bad in Vietnam. His back is wired with a computer so he can stand up.
So anyway, they finally let him go.
And I'm thinking, you dummy, Joe. I would never.
(1:11:56)</p><p>When they warn you, get away.
You don't mess with them.
(1:12:01)</p><hr><p>You don't keep going because they can really do some damage.
So anyway, you know, it's not hard.
It really isn't. I tell people, use your imagination.
It's not your imagination.
Do it.
Okay, so what did you see when you did it?
Well, you know, there are, you know, to see, I've tried to, like a camera, focusing in on like gauges.
Maybe some can do it, but I can't. But I have found out that when I was getting into remote viewing, you could not go to a safe in Moscow and look in the safe and find a document and read it.
(1:12:44)</p><p>Now they can do it anywhere, any remote viewer.
The Russians can do it.
You can go into a safe somewhere 10,000 miles away, go down to the stack and find the document.
You won't read it.
The Russians can do it.
We can do it.
The Americans can do it.
You know, probably British, you know, you name it.
So now they can do that.
(1:13:03)</p><p>But I tried.
I'm not, I can't do it.
But anyway, I would, the ships always have a light source that there's no, you can't tell where it's coming from.
It's just lit up.
It's a soft light and there's no sharp corners in a ship.
There's nothing you can get bump into and get hurt on these alien crafts.
And everything's smooth, everything's smooth.
But they do control the ship.
(1:13:29)</p><p>Most of them do control the ship with their minds.
They'll sit in a chair and put a headset like this on.
And that's what, that's what controls the ship.
I mean, they're not there with, you know, tractor deals in a hand.
So anyway, that's my, it's not hard to do.
It's not hard to do, but I don't do it anymore.
I've done it for a long time.
(1:13:50)</p><p>I just, I'm just not.
So that's what you saw up there.
You saw the rounded walls and the direct lighting and all of that.
Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's like, it's like it's a, it's like a opaque.
It's almost never clear.
I have been in places where I projected to and it was clear, crystal clear.
But most of the time it's opaque.</p></div></div></details>

<p>Tom Dongo<sup><a href="https://ouchaku.github.io/ds/blog/2024/10/15/tom_dongo_pic#user-content-fn-1-3b1aa8" id="user-content-fnref-1-3b1aa8" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup>がインタビューの中で上の写真を提示していた。彼は否定派が主張するような二重露光の写真ではないと強調している。この写真を見れば、すぐにこの巨大 UFO の正体に気付く筈。確かに二重露光ではないし、写真の細工もなされていない。今は時間が取れないので後日、解説を行う予定。</p>
<p>この程度の写真ですら即座に正体を見抜けずに二重露光だのテールパイプだのと宣っているようでは「否定派<sup><a href="https://ouchaku.github.io/ds/blog/2024/10/15/tom_dongo_pic#user-content-fn-2-3b1aa8" id="user-content-fnref-2-3b1aa8" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup>の人材不足もかなり深刻だなぁ、お気の毒に」と他人事ながら不憫になる。</p>

<p>さて、本番前にお見せしたこの写真をアップしたい。
素晴らしい写真だが、そろそろ時間がなくなってきた。
あと15分ほどしかない。
でも、これはとても興味深い写真だ。
ここで私たちが見ているものについて、少し話してもらえないだろうか。
(1:34:23)</p>
<p>僕は何度も攻撃され、論破されてきた。
私は3回辞めたよ。
耐えられなかった。
特に論破されると気が狂いそうになる。
今でもそうだ。
彼らは自分が間違っていることを証明しようとするんだ。
それで私は3回、完全にやめた。
もうたくさんだ。
もうやらない。
UFOが墜落するとか、そういうことが起きたんだ。
(1:34:48)</p>
<p>で、とにかく、ある男が言ったんだ。
デマだ。
と言った。
彼はそれに答えられなかった。
でも、これは誰かがこの女性を撮影した実際の写真なんだ。
そしてこれは、つまり、55年型シボレーのテールパイプhのように見える。でもデマじゃない。
何であれ本物だ。
(1:35:14)</p>
<p>そしてこれはボイントン・キャニオンにある。ここは地球上で最も奇妙な場所のひとつで、とにかくそうだった。
これはとても神聖な岩だ。
何か異次元のもののように見える。
見えない人のために説明しておくと、セドナ・キャニオンのあたりに女性が立っている。
彼女の頭上にはオレンジと赤の空が広がっている。
そしてこの大きなものがある。
あなたが言ったように、どう表現していいかわからない。
(1:35:44)</p>
<p>チェサピークのようだ。城のようにも見える。
だから何度も、ああ、これは二重露光だ、と言われる。
じゃあ、どうして二重露光なんだ？
彼らはそれに答えられない。
論破論者はいつも何かを思いつく。
そして私は、私が持っているものは何でも、どうにかして証明できると言う。
そして証明した。
しかし、論駁者たちは私を3回も辞めさせた。
懐疑論者には耐えられなかった。
(1:36:10)</p>
<p>ねえ、僕もそう思うよ。
(1:36:12)</p>
<hr>
<p>特にソーシャルメディアでは悪質だ。
クレイジーだ。
そうだな
論破するのは勝手だが 証拠がないと話にならん
写真分析、写真の周波数分析、フィルムの種類、これが何、あれが何というように、あらゆる機材を揃えなければならない。
写真を分解して、さまざまなレイヤーを見るには長い時間がかかるんだ。
(1:36:48)</p>
<p>それに科学者、論破する科学者が必要だ。
だから、誰かがただ、私はそれを論破した、と言っているのなら、私はそこには行かない。
そのようなことができる、本当に能力のある人が話してくれるのを待つよ。</p>
<details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary>▼文字起こし 原文 展開</summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><p>Well, I want to pop up this photo that I showed you before the show.
It's an extraordinary photo and we're beginning to run out of time.
We've got about 15 minutes left.
But this is a very interesting photo.
I wonder if you could talk a little bit about what we're looking at here.
(1:34:23)</p><p>You know, I've been attacked and debunked so many times.
I've quit three times.
I couldn't take it.
And this was, you know, especially the debunkers drive me nuts.
They still do.
You know, they're trying to prove you're wrong, you know.
And so I quit three times, totally quit.
I said, I'm done with this.
I'm not doing it anymore.
Something would happen, a UFO crash or something.
(1:34:48)</p><p>And anyway, this was, some guy said, oh, that's hoax.
It's a hoax.
I said, okay, how do you hoax it?
And he couldn't answer that.
But it's, that's an actual photograph of somebody was taking a picture of this woman.
And this appeared in the, I mean, you know, it looks like the tailpipe of a 55 Chevy. But it's not hoaxed.
It's a real thing, whatever it is.
(1:35:14)</p><p>And this is in Boynton Canyon, which is one of the strangest places on earth, or it was anyways.
And this is a very holy rock.
It looks like something interdimensional.
For those who can't see, it shows a woman standing in the Sedona Canyon area.
And above her, the sky is all orange and red.
And there's this large thing.
Like you said, I don't even know how to describe it.
(1:35:44)</p><p>It looks like a Chesapeake. It looks like a castle.
So many times people say, oh, that's a double exposure.
Then I say, how is it a double exposure?
Then they can't answer that.
The debunkers always think of something.
And I say, whatever I have, I can prove it somehow.
And I do.
But the debunkers made me quit three times.
I couldn't take the skeptics.
(1:36:10)</p><p>Hey, I'm right there with you.
(1:36:12)</p><hr><p>It's vicious out there, especially on social media.
It's crazy.
Yeah, yeah.
The thing about a debunker is you can debunk all day, but without proof of your ability to do that, it's really crazy.
And you'd have to have all the equipment, like photographic analyzing, frequency analyzing of the picture, what kind of film was it, what it was this, what it was that.
And it takes a long time to take a picture apart and look at its different layers and all of that.
(1:36:48)</p><p>And it would take a scientist, a debunking scientist.
So if somebody is just saying, well, I debunked it, I wouldn't go there.
I'd wait for somebody with some real ability to do that to talk about it.</p></div></div></details>

<p>53:00--</p>
<p>私は任務として公式に UFO を遠隔視した唯一の Star Gate Program のメンバーだ。</p>
<p>ICBM 基地上空に出現した 100m の UFO を軍が偶然、写真撮影した。4 000 マイル/時、14000 ft 上空、直角に方向を変化させた。</p>
<p>軍は、私（Joseph McMoneagle）にその正体を遠隔視するように依頼した。</p>
<p>私が行った遠隔視の結果と軍の UFO 観察情報は一致した。UFO の形状は斜めにギザギザが見えた。</p>
<p>遠隔視で、その UFO 内部に ET がいるのが見えた。</p>
<p>58:00 彼ら（の本当の姿は）は（グレイなどのような） ET ではない。彼らは外部環境保護服（environmenttal protective suits）を着ているから（グレイのような） ET に見える。それを私は skin suit （皮膚服）と呼んでいる。</p>
<p>その UFO 内部を何度か、繰り返し遠隔視して、見えたのが下の光景。</p>
<a href="https://ouchaku.github.io/ds/img/20210212_jm_fig.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="20210212_jm_fig.jpg" border="0" src="https://ouchaku.github.io/ds/img/20210212_jm_fig.jpg" width="90%"></a>
<p>この光景について 3か月も考えていたが、ある夜中、気づいた。それは空の箱の角だと。UFO 内部の ET が遠隔視をしている私に気づき、わざと私に空の箱の角を見せたのだと。それに気づいてからは、UFO の内部の他の光景も断片的に見えてきた。</p>

<p>UFO の内部を遠隔視したら、その内部にいた ET に（未来から）遠隔視していることを気づかれた…という他の証言は下の過去記事でも取り上げた。</p>
<blockquote><p>・Courtney Brown がインタビューで語った話の中から興味を惹いた部分のみざっと紹介する。いまさらインタビュー動画を見返す気はないので、既に曖昧になりつつある記憶だけが頼り。なので信頼度はそれなり。気になるひとは動画を観るべき。</p><ul>
<li>
<p>1997年にアリゾナ州上空に出現し、大勢が目撃した巨大 UFO を遠隔視した。その遠隔視では UFO 中の ET がいるのが見えた（上のホワイトボードのスケッチを参照）。この ET は遠隔視実演者の存在を感知し、遠隔視実演者の視線へ姿勢を向きあわせた。そして遠隔視実演者と（テレパシーで？）コミュニケーションを行った。ET は遠隔視実演者の質問に答えて UFO の移動方法などを教えてくれたと。</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>遠隔視の対象が人間の場合、遠隔視実演者の存在を（遠隔視されている人間が）感知することはかつて一度も起きたことがない。だが、ET の場合には過去にも同様のことが起きている。</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>重要な事は、遠隔視を実演したのは 2015年で、遠隔視の対象となった UFO の中の ET は 1997年だったという事。そしてこの 1997年当時の ET は 2015年の未来から遠隔視されていることを理解していた（遠隔視実演者に理解している事を告げた）。</p>

<h3>コメント</h3>
<p>このような（UFO の内部の ET が未来から遠隔視されていることに気づいた）事例は、たぶん事実ではない筈。遠隔視は、それが十分に機能している時は、ある種の変性意識状態（＝意識機能が正常状態から逸脱している状態）になっている。それゆえに、事実とはかけ離れた夢想的シーンを見たのだろう。</p>
<p>遠隔視と同様に、退行催眠も変性意識状態（＝意識機能が正常状態から逸脱している状態）を引き起こす。それゆえに同様の下の過去記事のような事例も生じる。</p>
<blockquote><p>退行催眠中の abductee に、ET に対して質問をさせることで過去の abduction 体験内容それ自体が（時間を遡って）変化した…そう Grant Cameron は主張してる。</p><p>同様の主張は遠隔視でもなされている。下の過去記事でも取り上げた。</p><p><a href="http://news21c.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-9314.html" target="_blank">Kerry Cassidy：Phoenix Lights の UFO の中の ET と Courtney Brown らが通信した件 （途中：その2）</a> (2017-09-03)</p><p>Grant Cameron は Barbara Lamb や Mary Rodwell の証言を元にタイトルの主張をしているが、ほぼ間違いなく彼らの認識は間違っている。</p><p>つまり、Barbara Lamb や Mary Rodwell が退行催眠中に投げかけた質問によって</p><ul>

52:46
the only remote viewer in the stargate
52:48
program
52:49
formally tasked with remote viewing
52:52
a ufo that was accidentally photographed
52:57
by overhead
53:00
tasked with photographing an icbm site
53:04
an intercontinental ballistic missile
53:05
site
53:07
during the photographing of that
53:08
particular target
53:10
they caught a vehicle uh
53:14
approximately 300 feet across flat as a
53:17
pancake
53:18
that made a 90 degree turn at over 4 000
53:22
miles per hour
53:24
at 14 000 feet over that particular
53:26
target
53:28
they have no idea that particular agency
53:30
has no idea what it is
53:32
and so they decided to task us with it
53:36
to see if we would see it or have a
53:38
response to it
53:40
i was asked to do the remote viewing
53:43
and uh i did and i did an excellent
53:46
remote viewing of the icbm site
53:48
the intercontinental ballistic missile
53:50
site and at the same time
53:54
um noticed at some point in the viewing
53:57
that something had passed
53:59
in front of my face i had been asked to
54:03
describe and draw the target which was
54:06
the icbm site
54:08
they said please please draw or describe
54:11
your target
54:12
from an altitude of approximately 14
54:15
000 feet looking obliquely at the ground
54:19
target
54:20
that's the way i was asked to respond
54:23
and that's the way i
54:24
did and at some point said i had a sense
54:27
that something passed in front of my
54:29
eyes
54:31
uh my remote viewing monitor who was
54:34
also blind to what we were working on
54:37
thought
54:38
at that point that i had probably seen
54:42
the top secret vehicle that had taken
54:44
the pictures of the icbm site
54:47
so he thought it would be really cool
54:50
if i was to describe or draw
54:54
this highly classified
54:57
whatever that had taken the photographs
54:59
of the icbm
55:00
site so he asked me to do that
55:05
and what i basically drew was a 300 foot
55:10
disc oblique with
55:14
serrated edges that
55:17
i described as making a 90 degree right
55:20
turn at approximately 3990 miles per
55:25
hour
55:26
at about 13 500 feet which match their
55:30
data
55:33
the other thing that that i said is that
55:36
it was manned and that the
55:40
uh the entities manning it uh
55:43
were unaffected completely unaffected by
55:46
the turn
55:48
by the speed or by their the movement of
55:50
their vehicle
55:52
which meant that they were probably
55:53
traveling in some form of singularity
55:58
and i had some other experiences later
56:00
when i attempted to
56:02
retarget the vehicle
56:06
i was i was distracted by
56:10
some things for instance i was asked to
56:14
[Music]
56:15
to retarget the vehicle i'm gonna try
56:18
something here
56:20
and what i initially got
56:24
i'm gonna draw it hold it up to the
56:26
camera so you can see it
56:28
so the audience can see it i was asked
56:32
to draw
56:33
my perception and i got this
56:37
and it took me approximately three
56:39
months to figure out what that
56:42
is i kept getting it over and over and
56:45
over
56:45
repetitively and after three months
56:49
i woke up in the middle of the night
56:51
knowing suddenly exactly what that was
56:54
it's what i believe to be the inside or
56:57
outside corner of an empty box
57:00
so these entities i believe know when
57:04
they're being targeted
57:05
psychically and they give us something
57:07
to play with
57:08
which is basically an empty box
57:11
and the reason i can say that with some
57:13
authority
57:15
is because since i've come to that
57:17
realization
57:19
what i get when i'm retargeted on that
57:21
particular
57:22
target now is boxes
57:25
i don't get the corners anymore i've
57:28
grad
57:28
graduated to the boxes
57:32
but what i also don't talk about is
57:35
once in a while
57:39
i catch them unawares so i get a glimpse
57:42
once in a while of different things bits
57:45
and pieces
57:46
of the interior of the vehicle and the
57:49
entities within it
57:51
and i've been collecting that material
57:53
for quite some time now
57:55
and i can safely say that
57:58
what we in our experience see
58:02
is not really aliens when there's an
58:05
interaction when someone has an
58:07
interaction with these aliens and
58:09
and they all describe basically the same
58:11
thing
58:12
the reason they're describing the same
58:15
thing
58:16
is because they're not seeing the aliens
58:18
they're seeing them dressed in their
58:20
environmental protective
58:22
suits they all wear
58:25
an environmental protective suit for
58:28
when they're in our environment
58:30
and part of that are lenses to protect
58:33
the eyes they
58:36
cover the mouth the nose the ears
58:40
or at least most of the those
58:43
appendages to the point that they don't
58:47
appear to be fully functional and
58:50
i call them skin suits or protective
58:52
suits
58:54
and i've come to that conclusion based
58:57
on collecting the information over many
59:00
years
59:01
[Music]
59:03
some of the other things that um
59:06
become apparent to me as well with
59:09
regard to
59:12
these possible crash vehicles and</p></div></div></details>

I'm gonna try something here, and what I initially got—I'm gonna draw it, hold it up to the camera so you can see it, so the audience can see it. I was asked to draw my perception, and I got this, and it took me approximately three months to figure out what that is. I kept getting it over and over and over, repetitively. And after three months, I woke up in the middle of the night knowing suddenly exactly what that was: it’s what I believe to be the inside or outside corner of an empty box.</p><p>So these entities, I believe, know when they're being targeted psychically, and they give us something to play with, which is basically an empty box. And the reason I can say that with some authority is because since I’ve come to that realization, what I get when I'm retargeted on that particular target now is boxes. I don’t get the corners anymore—I’ve graduated to the boxes. But what I also don’t talk about is once in a while, I catch them unawares, so I get a glimpse once in a while of different things—bits and pieces of the interior of the vehicle and the entities within it. And I’ve been collecting that material for quite some time now.</p><p>And I can safely say that what we, in our experience, see is not really aliens. When there’s an interaction, when someone has an interaction with these aliens, and they all describe basically the same thing, the reason they’re describing the same thing is because they’re not seeing the aliens. They’re seeing them dressed in their environmental protective suits. They all wear an environmental protective suit for when they’re in our environment, and part of that are lenses to protect the eyes. They cover the mouth, the nose, the ears, or at least most of those appendages to the point that they don’t appear to be fully functional. And I call them "skin suits" or "protective suits," and I’ve come to that conclusion based on collecting the information over many years.</p><p>Some of the other things that, um, become apparent to me as well with regard to these possible crash vehicles and...</p><p>和訳：</p><p>私は、スタargateプログラムにおいて唯一、UFOのリモートビューイング（遠隔透視）を正式に任されたリモートビューアーでした。それは、ICBM（大陸間弾道ミサイル）基地を空中から撮影する任務中に偶然撮影されたUFOでした。その特定のターゲットを撮影中、幅およそ300フィート、パンケーキのように平らな乗り物が、4,000マイル以上の速度で高度14,000フィートの位置から90度の方向転換を行う様子が捉えられたのです。その機関はそれが何であるか全くわからず、私たちにそのリモートビューイングを任せ、何か見えるか反応があるかを確認しようとしました。</p><p>私はリモートビューイングを依頼され、ICBM基地の透視に成功しました。同時に、透視中に何かが私の目の前を通り過ぎるのを感じました。ターゲットであるICBM基地を描写し、描くよう依頼されました。彼らは「高度約14,000フィートから地上のターゲットを斜めに見て、ターゲットを描写または描いてください」と言いました。そのように対応し、その通りに行いました。その時、何かが私の目の前を通り過ぎたと感じました。</p><p>私のリモートビューイングの監督者は、私たちが何をしているのか知らされていなかったため、私がICBM基地を撮影した極秘の乗り物を見たのではないかと思いました。彼はその極秘の乗り物を私が描写または描くのは面白いと考え、依頼してきました。私は、幅300フィートで、ギザギザの縁を持つ円盤を描き、それが約3,990マイルの速度で13,500フィートの高度から90度の右折をしたと説明しました。それは、彼らのデータとも一致していました。</p><p>さらに、私はその乗り物が有人であり、その操縦者たちは、旋回や速度、乗り物の動きに全く影響を受けていないと述べました。これは、おそらく彼らが何らかの「特異点」状態で移動していたことを意味していました。そして、その後、私はその乗り物を再ターゲティングしようとした時、いくつかの事柄に気を取られました。</p><p>たとえば、私は再ターゲティングを依頼され、初めに得たものを描き、それをカメラに向けて観客に見せました。私は自分の認識を描写するよう依頼され、それを何度も繰り返し受け取るうちに、約3か月後、突然夜中に目が覚めて、その物が何であるかを正確に理解しました。それは、空っぽの箱の内側か外側の角であると私は信じています。</p><p>こうした存在は、誰かが精神的に彼らをターゲティングしていることを知り、私たちに「空の箱」を与えて遊ばせるのだと考えています。このことをある程度の確信を持って言える理由は、私がその理解に至って以来、そのターゲットに対して再ターゲティングすると、箱を見受けるようになったからです。最初の頃の角ではなく、今では箱そのものを見ているのです。</p><p>また、時折、私は彼らの不意をつき、乗り物の内部やその中にいる存在の一部を垣間見ることもあります。長年にわたりその情報を収集してきました。私たちが経験するものが、本当の意味での「エイリアン」ではないと言えます。彼らが目にしているのは、環境保護スーツを着た姿だからです。</p></div></div>

<details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary>▼文字起こし 原文 展開</summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><p>On November the 10th of 1994, a Claremont County resident recorded several minutes of home video footage showing an object comprised of four headlights in a triangular arrangement.
The soundless object seems to demonstrate a rolling motion that would appear to place a conventional aircraft in an upside-down inverted pitch at the conclusion of the maneuver.
The videotape and the claim was thoroughly investigated, and others in the same area also told of similar occurrences in the weeks before and after the recording was made.
(0:00:47)</p><p>The mysterious object was picked up on the home video camera after witnesses described hearing explosive sounds.
I was in bed sound asleep, and all of a sudden I heard some boom, booming sounds.
And I got up, and I came out and asked my son what all the noise was. He said, Mom, I don't know.
(0:01:28)</p><p>So I opened up the door to look outside, and there were so many intense lights that it was something. So I started yelling, Oh my God, where's my camera?
I videotaped the lights going across and over top of the field across the street. They were just on the other side of the dumpster here.
(0:01:49)</p><p>They were very low. Some of them were coming in one direction and would stop and go back in the opposite direction. Some of them would stop in mid-air, and there would be like two of them at a time over top of each other, and they would separate and go in opposite directions.
This is the video Barb recorded on November the 10th, 1994. Barb also recorded videotape of an actual airplane traveling overhead.
(0:02:26)</p><p>Comparing this video with the one of the object that Barb says is weird gives us the impression that the aircraft engine noise from the plane can be heard very clearly, and the unidentified object seems to make no sound at all.
November 10th was a strange night in Owensville. Along with Barb and her videotape, there were quite a few others who told of eerie glowing lights that zipped about on that rainy night.
(0:02:57)</p><p>Some did not want to appear on camera. One resident, Larry Moore, says he does not know Barb and has no knowledge of her videotape, but he saw something that he could not identify.
or something that low like that it's something i've never seen before but it went when it came so fast like that he just suddenly stopped and it was about like 30 foot up above trees and it was just a big bright light like it had some kind of a glow to it but i couldn't figure out what it was as i was standing there watching the lights All of a sudden, I noticed that there was a sheriff right there in front of my house.
(0:04:05)</p><p>There was a sheriff.
Oh boy, he's speeding up now.
You saw it right here.
Listen to him.
That was good.
I bet somebody called.
There was a very intense light behind the dumpster.
(0:04:33)</p><hr><p>The sheriff must have noticed it because at that time he sped up very noticeably in his car.
I followed him as far as I could with video camera over to the church where he sat and watched the lights also.
There goes the sheriff.
After sitting here for a few minutes.
And here he's facing one. How about that?
Got sheriff sitting right under one.
(0:05:04)</p><p>And they sit there.
They're having like a stare down face off for a couple minutes.
And the light is just sitting motionlessly up in the sky. There's no sound.
Then all of a sudden the light pulls to the right.
The sheriff's taillights change again.
And he pulls up and pulls to the right as if he's following it.
What happened that night?
An attempt was made to locate the officer who was on the video.
(0:05:47)</p><p>Sheriff's going to follow him.
There he goes. Chasing him.
But our efforts were futile.
We spoke with Lieutenant Wilson of the Claremont County Sheriff's Department. Who said he checked into it.
And he told us that he had no information.
And no reports were made.
Lights in the night sky don't impress me he said.
And that our job is protecting people.
As long as one of these bad boys don't hurt anyone.
(0:06:19)</p><p>It's not our concern.
When asked to make an on camera comment about the videotape.
Claremont County Sheriff John Van Camp abruptly stepped in.
And curtly said, go find someplace else to film.
The Owensville recording was taken to Associates for Scientific Knowledge Investigator and Computer Specialist Dale Farmer. For a comprehensive examination.
Right now I kind of think it's probably man-made. Probably some kind of experimental aircraft that the Air Force or Navy is experimenting with.
(0:07:04)</p><p>Most notable through computer enhancement is the appearance of a structured surface behind the large aircraft headlights.
Extensive computer analysis has detailed a possible triangular outline of what may be a solid structure connecting the lights.
Further complicating the circumstances surrounding the Claremont County recording.
Another videotape of a similar object was recorded several months later near Marysville, Ohio. This video recording was made by a news crew from a Columbus, Ohio television station while producing a story on UFO sightings in that area.
(0:08:03)</p><p>Like the Claremont County recording, this videotape shot by the staff of a Columbus, Ohio news station also shows an object comprised of big bright headlights in a triangular shape.
Unknown triangular shaped objects have been reported in all parts of the world.
This object, similar in appearance to the Claremont County recording, was photographed over Belgium. This videotape was taken in 1981 over the Soviet Union. Compare the similarities.
(0:08:47)</p><p>Are these secretive military aircrafts?
And if so, why are they parading about residential areas, performing odd maneuvers, and shining brilliant headlight beams for all to see?
On October 19, 1994, a motorist traveling on westbound I-275 reported to the Forest Park Police Department that an unidentified flying object appeared near the Forest Fair Mall. According to the police report, the driver claims to have experienced a paralysis influence from a brilliant beam of light radiating from the unknown aircraft.
(0:09:30)</p><p>Within a matter of days, a mushroom-shaped object was reported hanging in the air in that same vicinity, approaching the Kemper and Pittman Road intersections.
(0:09:39)</p><hr><p>And just weeks later, WLWT Channel 5 News reported on a strange event close to the Interstate I-74 and I-275 interchanges.
Presumed by witnesses to be a falling plane on fire before disappearing in a brilliant flash of light.
In late October and early November of 1994, we spoke with several residents in Owensville, Ohio, all of whom allegedly observed UFOs floating around Zebulon Park, an apartment complex near U.S. Route 50. When it came so fast like that, it just suddenly stopped. And it was about like 30 foot above the trees. And it was just a big bright light, like it had some kind of a glow to it. But I couldn't figure out what it was.
(0:10:28)</p><p>On November 10, 1994, a resident in the apartment complex recorded several minutes of home video footage depicting unusual looking lights that seemed to materialize during a rainstorm.
The glowing lights on the recording appears to have been observed by an on-duty patrol officer operating with the Claremont County Sheriff's Department. And here he's facing one. How about that? Got Sheriff sitting right under one.
A prearranged agreement was made with the authorities at the Claremont County Sheriff's Department who were asked for their comment on the recording.
(0:11:05)</p><p>After the administrators viewed the material at their request, the official comment provided by the department was, go find someplace else to film.
The videotape was offered the next morning to a pair of local news channels, WLWT Channel 5 and WKRC Channel 12, but the response was one of indifference, disinterest, and flat-out rejection of the video without either news service ever examining its content.
(0:11:30)</p><p>In March of 1995, two separate reports from independent witnesses were made during a two-week period in which the alarmed individuals reported seeing a black globular object that shadowed and stalked passenger airliners as they approached Cincinnati airports.
Investigations were still continuing into the bullet-shaped object seen over Vermont that was described as sounding like a street sweeper which caused houses to vibrate violently.
On April 14, 1995, an event took place in the Mariemont area that was recorded to the police. The audio recording of the call that you are about to hear was obtained from the Hamilton County Sheriff's Department Dispatch and Communication Center. The identity of the caller has been withheld for privacy purposes.
(0:12:19)</p><p>Police dispatcher Skinner. Yes, I was on my way down Plainville to Mariemont. And, let's see, I can't think of the name of the street it is now. I know it's Plainville, but I've seen something I know I shouldn't have seen.
It's right off of Plainville. So I'm trying to get ahold of Military Base. I know it sounds stupid and ridiculous, but I know we ain't got no aircrafts in our square. But it's down Plainville somewhere. I don't know. I've circled it about four or five times. Cambridge. I went around four or five times. I don't know if it's a little cube, a little helicopter toy or something. But it's not right, so I'm trying to get ahold of Military Base all night tonight.
(0:13:02)</p><p>How long ago was it that you saw it? About 20 minutes ago.
(0:13:27)</p><p>I don't know if it's just a bunch of people out there goofing off in some square. But I know we ain't got no aircrafts in our square. I'm 22 years old, by the way. I know we ain't got no aircrafts in our square. I'm bringing an orange light. It sounds stupid and ridiculous, but... Where was it sitting at? Right on the side of the road?
(0:13:30)</p><p>Five lights up here. All of a sudden, I looked up and saw it. And it stopped. It started dropping straight down. So I don't know if it's somebody, like I said, somebody playing a practical joke or something.
(0:13:43)</p><hr><p>And how big was it, do you think?
How big was it?
About the size of a Toyota Corolla. One interesting aspect of this case, which tends to lend credibility to it, is the fact that the witnesses took the time to report what they allegedly saw to the police. Most hoaxers wouldn't do that.
Associates for Scientific Knowledge Investigator Charles Stewart began investigations into the case immediately upon receiving the information, and an attempt was made to obtain more documentation of the alleged event.
(0:14:17)</p><p>Through a thorough investigation, we were able to track down the witnesses, and they took us to the site.
The witnesses, both of them, seemed real credible to me. Everything they told us from beginning to end, there was no inconsistencies in anything they told us. I'd say they're very credible witnesses, and as a matter of fact, neither one of them wanted any publicity for what they had seen.
(0:14:43)</p><p>The caller was willing to give investigators a detailed account of the declared occurrence, and contended that the UFO first appeared about three stories in the air, before suddenly dropping to an elevation nearly ten feet from the ground.
According to the witnesses, the object which they saw was hovering at treetop level, and illuminating the roof of a house and a tree.
Well, we were thinking that if this thing was really as close to the house as it was reported, that someone in the house may have heard something, or saw a flash of light, or maybe a neighbor had come up and asked them some questions about something the night before, so we thought we'd ask around a little bit in the neighborhood. We got some interesting responses.
(0:15:25)</p><p>Investigators spoke with a resident from nearby Madisonville, residing just blocks away from the sighting, who claims to have observed something suspended low over railroad tracks in the neighborhood.
First I thought it was like a boxcar at the end of a train. It's hard to say because when you're not expecting anything that late at night, it's hard to say. It's hard to say if it was pulsating or if it was just by being dark and the lights were just blinking, I don't know.
(0:16:03)</p><p>And it was sitting over two tracks that was right down there about 50, 75 yards down. It was triangle-like. Moorhead sits nestled among the foothills and tall pines of eastern Kentucky. The lifestyle is relaxed and the hustle and bustle of a big city is many miles away.
But for a few hours on November 21st, 2003, that peaceful tranquility would be replaced by confusion and fear. A strange event would grip this Kentucky town.
(0:16:52)</p><p>A University of Kentucky psychologist along with his two sons were driving home near Adams Lane. They saw a bright light in the northwestern sky. The soundless aerial object hovered over a nearby open field and a sense of apprehension was upon the professor and his sons.
What is that?
This gentleman lives way up on a hill, very wooded, very isolated, and I could see where there would be few witnesses to this. I believe, and this is just my belief, I believe that the witnesses that we interviewed in this particular case are all penitent.
(0:17:50)</p><p>The UK professor and his sons ran indoors. With some concern, making their way to the second story window where they continued to watch this object.
(0:18:01)</p><hr><p>Of course, Kenny Young made the first contact with the first witness and I kept digging until I found a second witness who lived right down the road. And the second witness described something very similar.
She said her and her daughter were out putting up Christmas tree lights and she said they turned around and they saw this object and it was popping up and going down. She said it was a light and she said it reminded her of popcorn going up and coming down.
(0:18:25)</p><p>Her daughter became very frightened and she told her to go in the house. This object came down, it turned several colors from orange to red, and as it touched the ground, this is when the dog went wild and started barking like crazy.
As the object seemed to touch down near Adams Lane, animals in the neighborhood erupted into a mad frenzy. Suddenly, the object shot off like a dart and disappeared into the western skies.
(0:19:03)</p><p>Immediately after the object departed, blood curling screams could be heard in the night.
One person on nearby Skaggs Road heard the screams and called the police.
Soon afterwards, the field where the screams emanated was crawling with police, fire and rescue searchers.
Thermal imaging was used to try to locate the woman, but nothing was found and the search was called off.
He said that it sounded like the most horrifying blood curling scream that he had ever heard. It sounded like somebody was being ripped apart, just totally ripped apart.
(0:20:51)</p><p>There has to be some connection. You know, over the years, there's been people talked about abductions and being abducted, and of course I've read about things in books, but I never experienced it firsthand as far as being able to talk to somebody who actually heard this.
And I would say yes. It's not common. It's not a very common thing. You don't hear these type of reports of somebody screaming blood curling screams and a UFO being spotted at the exact same time.
(0:21:25)</p><p>It sounds like somebody was hurt. So, you know, I think about it often. I think about, is that lady, is she alive? Is she in Moorhead? Is she from somewhere else? Is she still around? Does she remember what happened later? And she's saying, you know, what happened to me and can I tell anybody?
The Moorhead, Kentucky case will remain a curious and puzzling episode without firm resolution. An unidentified flying object was observed, and from the same location in the field, desperate and blood-curling screams were heard in the night.
(0:22:13)</p><p>A police search yielded no answers.
Lives have been affected and disturbing questions have been raised.
We have no real answers to the strange events in Moorhead, Kentucky, in November of 2003. On February the 2nd, 2002, an anonymous witness from Maysville, Kentucky, filed an online UFO report complaining of a strange aircraft seen over the Ohio River between the power plants.
Investigation of that claim revealed that a security guard at one of the plants along the river had simultaneously noted the sighting of an unusual aircraft in his logbook.
(0:23:12)</p><p>Despite this strong authentication of the sighting report, local Maysville, Kentucky, news media expressed no interest in further exploring this subject.
(0:23:21)</p><hr><p>In the following months, a number of similar reports began to surface from the Ohio River city of Portsmouth. One resident claiming that he would sight an unusual object in the late night hours as it hovered in the vicinity of the bridges.
And on May the 1st, 2003, a UFO was seen near Ashland, Kentucky. The black triangular object, the size of a small car, allegedly flew near the Route 60 bridge.
(0:23:53)</p><p>On May the 3rd, in Flemingsburg, Kentucky, a crop circle appeared in a rye field along T-Run Road. New tonight in more local news, independent investigators descend on a tri-state rye field after hearing about crop circles.
According to the initial witnesses, including Fleming County Sheriff, Jerry Wagner, the donut-shaped formation was a perfect circle 50 yards in diameter.
On June the 2nd, a resident of Westchester, Ohio, reported a dramatic UFO sighting near his residence.
(0:24:38)</p><p>That was accompanied by a local power failure. The witness, awakened around 2.30 a.m. by the beeping sound of a battery backup to his computer, detected the smell of ozone and went to his window to see an odd object in the sky.
The disk-shaped object was compared to the size of a bus with bright lights spinning very fast.
The lights spun so fast they almost appeared to strobe or pulsate.
(0:25:04)</p><p>On June the 6th, at 2.30 a.m., in Monroe, Ohio, a Butler County resident observed an unusual bulb-shaped UFO at a thousand foot elevation, traveling from a south to northwest direction. At the moment, the object was directly overhead.
The witness claims he lost satellite reception and the lights in his house dimmed.
And at 11 p.m. on August the 22nd, at Hillsboro, Ohio, an enormous object was seen in the eastern sky.
(0:25:34)</p><p>Cincinnati UFO investigator Donnie Blessing was told that multiple witnesses observed a circular object that had rotating sets of white lights around the center.
The object was described as a huge, enormous UFO. It was dark so they could see the silhouette of it. It was compared to if you took two school buses and put them side by side.
Two days later, in nearby Locust Grove, Ohio, a crop circle was discovered in a soybean field across from the legendary Serpent Mound Indian Burial Grounds. It's artistic geometry on a canvas of soybeans. 300 foot in diameter, but perhaps more impressive?
(0:26:15)</p><p>It's religious. It's fascinating.
The number of people coming to see it. This woman works at Serpent Mound, just across the street from the crop circle.
Somebody came in yesterday and said, where's the crop circle? Where's the crop circle? It's right across the street. Go to your right. You'll see it.
Even long-time residents like Mildred Jamison... We've been around here for about 50-some years.
(0:26:37)</p><p>...can't remember anything quite like this.
I said, I better be watching things out here.
Following separate reports of UFOs sighted in Bethel, Ohio, and objects videotaped from Bainbridge, Akron, and Canton, residents in Proctorville and Chesapeake, Ohio complained of mysterious flashing lights chasing each other on Sunday and Monday nights, August the 31st and September the 1st. The Lawrence County Sheriff's Department received phone calls inquiring about the lights, as did television stations WOWK and WSAZ. Meanwhile, a spectacular crop formation was discovered near the Seat Mound Indian Burial Ground in Ross County, Ohio. They're here.
(0:27:30)</p><p>You know, when I first heard about this, I didn't know what to think. But you told me the secret.
(0:27:33)</p><hr><p>Well, I mean, yeah.
The secret.
I guess there is a little secret to it. I mean, they put down these boards and kind of compressed the crops.
Ohio UFO sightings continued on September the 13th, 2003. When an Adams County resident reported a tremendous object seen near Belfast, a total of four witnesses spoke of a triangular-shaped formation of lights on one large object.
The lights reportedly flashed in the sequence and would simultaneously alternate in color from pinkish red, blue, white, to yellow.
(0:28:06)</p><p>The triangular arrangement of the lights were comprised of four or five lights, with a peak of the triangle facing downward at the bottom.
On Monday evening, September the 22nd, around 7.30 p.m., a massive UFO was sighted in Franklin County, Ohio. A motorist traveling on Beaverbrook Road observed a colossal disc-shaped object floating silently overhead.
The witness, interviewed at length by the National Institute for Discovery Science and MUFON investigators, said the monstrous object seen near Gahanna, Ohio, was floating silently over the treetops.
(0:28:42)</p><p>On September the 23rd, Mason County, Kentucky, schoolteacher Martha Franklin and her husband, Michael, captured strange images on a deer surveillance camera mounted in a woodland on their property in Ellsbury, Ohio. The photographs published in the Adams County People's Defender newspaper seemed to challenge the rational explanation.
The camera, used to photograph wildlife, can be triggered by motion or heat source, and documented several photographs, one showing a saucer-shaped light source above the tree line.
(0:29:17)</p><p>And at 10.30 p.m. on September the 24th, a resident of Franklin, Ohio, contacted Wright-Patterson Air Force Base to report a remarkable UFO seen in the sky near her Butler County home.
A medical assistant, she and her three children spotted a strange pattern of huge green flashing lights when approaching her residence in the Heartland subdivision.
On Wednesday, October the 15th, Mr. Stuart Linder of Hamilton, Ohio, spotted an object that was hovering over Hamilton High School in Hamilton, Ohio. The UFO, described as multicolored, upside-down diamond, rotated in place, emanating a glow for about 10 minutes before speeding away to the west.
(0:30:02)</p><p>We can't speculate on what's going on, but there has been an upsurge in reports of UFOs and crop circles.
We just take the reports as they come in, and we don't make any speculation on what's going on.
Will the challenge of UFO investigation reveal evidence of UFO visitation?
In light of the undeniable upsurge of local sightings, we are compelled to wonder, what, or who, are these visitors to our skies?
(0:30:37)</p><p>Perhaps only time will tell.
Center of Police. Yeah, this is the Mount Emergency call.
Okay. I'm over on the south of the road, and I probably had other people call you, but I just want to make sure I keep electricity from flickering.
And I keep seeing out the window, the skylight up, and something loud, like a transformer humming. Have you been made aware of that?
(0:31:13)</p><p>No, nobody's called on that. Okay, is it behind your residence that you're seeing this?
(0:31:19)</p><hr><p>Actually, it lights up the entire sky.
Okay. And it is not anywhere where I can see it.
I'm sorry, let me get this 911 call, sir, just a moment.
911, Police Fire Medical. Yes, my name is Dennis Lewis, 174 Linden Drive, Centerville. Yes. We're getting loud or large electrical flashes off the power supply system behind our house.
Okay, can you see, I just have, on the other line, I have someone from Bessel Road, Bessel. I mean, and he's seeing the same thing. Is your electricity flickering?
(0:31:58)</p><p>Yes, it's, it comes on and off, and we're getting like a huge flash, and it's done about four times.
And the flash, where, outside?
Yes, outside. The lights just all came back on again.
Okay, I mean, is it from your backyard? Do you think it's immediately in your view line?
We think it's immediately close. I was trying to call PQNL, but there's a huge computerized, no-person phone line.
(0:32:22)</p><p>Okay. All right.
I haven't been able to see it actually arc. We just see a huge flash.
Okay, we're going to send someone out, okay, sir?
Thank you very much.
All right, thank you. Goodbye. Oh, my other call was about the same thing. He lived on Linden Drive, and he is being flashing, maybe by his tree line.
Okay. I'm sorry, I have another 911 call.
(0:32:49)</p><p>Okay, bye-bye. What's your address on Bessel?
105. 105. Thank you, sir. Bye. 911, please fire medical.
Has the whole street called?
No, sir. What is this about?
The whole street. The electricity is going on and off, and there's really... What is your address? I'm getting more phone calls on this.
Okay, 166 Lakeview. Okay. All right.
Holy crap. There's something in the sky.
Okay, just one moment, sir.
(0:33:25)</p><p>911?
Yes, my name is John McKeith, and I'm calling from Elmwood Drive. Okay. All right. About flashing?
Yes, that's right.
Okay. All right. Okay, we're going to check this out, sir.
Okay, we're not the first to call that.
No, no, sir.
Okay, thank you.
All right, thank you. Goodbye. 911, please.
Yes, do you happen to know what's going on in our neighborhood?
No, we're having an officer in the area. What is your address?
(0:33:59)</p><p>157 Brad Street. I tried to call DTNL, but it's automated.
Okay. Do you see exactly where it's coming from?
Well, if I look out my kitchen window, looking up towards the pool... Exactly. I'm sorry. What pool?
Stingling, and it looks... the sky just lit up pink.
Okay. All right. Towards Stingling?
Yeah. Okay. All right.
Okay, thank you.
Bye. Bye. Oh, my God. Oh, hello?
(0:34:30)</p><p>Yeah. I'm sorry. I've had about ten calls since then.
What did they say?
Everybody's just saying the same thing. The last person is on Brad Street, and she's saying it's more towards Stingling. I saw it.
Okay. My wife and I both saw it. It was right outside our window.
Right, okay. And your address again, sir?
(0:34:49)</p><hr><p>166 Lakeview. Okay. All right. I'm sorry. I've got about ten strips here.
Are they saying it's the same thing that I'm saying it is?
Yes. It looked like a freaking alien ship.
Right. Yes. And it blew up. Like, it was like a bomb going off.
Okay. Was it pink?
It was white.
The lady said it was pink.
No. It was going to the power lines, but it was... it hovered in. It came... I sound like I'm insane right now. I can't believe I'm saying this.
(0:35:17)</p><p>It hovered down over the school, and it was spinning lights and flashing.
Okay. It came down all the way, like, over the school towards my house.
Okay. And then it would just go... All right.
Boom! And the whole... all the electricity would go off in this giant... Okay. ...plane ball in the sky.
Okay. All right. I need to get going and let the officers know. Okay?
(0:35:39)</p><p>Okay. All right. Thank you. Bye-bye. Okay.

<p>ET との遭遇とも、妖精との遭遇とも解釈されがちな事例。</p>
<p>この小人と前世での関係が語られているが、同様のことは UFO の中で対面した ET との間でも生じている。</p>
<p>「瞑想状態に入った」と証言にあるとおり、日常活動における意識状態とは乖離している状態だったことにも留意。</p>

<p>ブラジルから来た驚くべき事例が、このエピソードの私のナレーションを説明している。
（0:03:16）</p>
<p>それについて聞こうと思っていたんだ。
リルボンゴとして知られる妖精の生き物がいる。リルボンゴ。この男がブラジルの特定の地域に行ったんだ。実際にはチリだったかもしれないが、今ではよく覚えていない。
そこは聖なる谷と考えられており、石の絵画や古代の遺物がある。
とても古い神秘的な場所だ。
彼がそこに行き、瞑想状態に入ったことに気づいた。
（0:03:43）</p>
<p>なぜそうなるのかはよくわからない。ただとてもリラックスして、穏やかな気分になる。
そして目を閉じて、瞑想というほどではないが、ただ自然と目の前の渓谷に対する畏敬の念に身をゆだねる。
目を開けると、腰にボンゴの太鼓をぶら下げた、身長30センチほどの裸の男がいた。
え？
数珠を身につけ、ドレッドヘアをしていた。でも、とても小さくて、身長は1フィートあるかないかだった。
（0:04:08）</p>
<p>そして、彼はその小さな男の子を見下ろした。そして、彼らは互いを見つめ合い、何回も何回も生まれ変わって知り合いだったことに気づいた。
前世のノームの経験みたいなものがあるの？
彼がこの谷に来たのは、前世でリル・ボンゴと交わした約束の一部だった。そして、リル・ボンゴと出会ったとき、彼には、リル・ボンゴの教えを世界に広めることが使命だとわかった。

<details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary>▼文字起こし 原文 展開</summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><p>There's an amazing case from Brazil which explains my lower thirds that I have for this episode.
(0:03:16)</p><p>I was going to ask you about that.
Where there's a fae creature known as Lil Bongo. Lil Bongo. It's this guy, he goes to this specific area in Brazil. It might actually be Chile, I can't quite remember now.
But it's considered like a sacred valley and there's stone paintings and ancient artifacts there.
It's a very old mystical place.
And he goes there and he finds himself entering a meditative state.
(0:03:43)</p><p>And he doesn't quite know why. He just feels so relaxed, so calm.
And he starts to close his eyes and enter into this kind of nice, not meditation, but just this reverence for nature and the valley before him.
And he opens his eyes and there's like a one foot tall little naked man with a bongo drum on his waist.
What?
And he's wearing beads and he's got dreadlocks. But he's tiny, he's like barely a foot tall.
(0:04:08)</p><p>And he looks down at this little guy who he ends up calling Lil Bongo. And they look at each other and they realize they've known each other many, many lifetimes.
There's like past life gnome experiences?
Him coming to this valley was part of a promise he made in a past life to Lil Bongo. And once he met Lil Bongo, he knew that his mission was to bring the teachings of Lil Bongo to the rest of the world.

<p>Grant Cameron のひとり語り動画から。Grant Cameron は冒頭から最期まで一人で延々と精神世界の与太話を語っている。だが、与太話に混じって、いくつか「目新しいタワゴト」も登場しているので、その中からタイトルの件に絞って取り上げる。</p>
<p>Barbara Lamb と Mary Rodwell が、いかに UFO/精神世界 業界におけるタワゴトの発生源となっているか、それがよく分かる内容。そのタワゴトを Grant Cameron は絶賛し、拡散役を買ってでている。</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="抜粋デタラメ">抜粋（デタラメ）<a href="https://ouchaku.github.io/ds/blog/2024/10/13/change_past_by_regressive_hypnosis#%E6%8A%9C%E7%B2%8B%E3%83%87%E3%82%BF%E3%83%A9%E3%83%A1" class="hash-link" aria-label="抜粋（デタラメ） への直接リンク" title="抜粋（デタラメ） への直接リンク">​</a></h2>
<p>Barbara Lamb (*2) による退行催眠。口頭による指示で過去の abduction 体験の内容が変化した。ET に質問すると、ET が腎臓に問題があるから医者にみせろと。最初の退行催眠ではこのような事は起きなかった。</p>
<p>つまり、ET に質問するようにという指示で過去の体験内容が変化した。</p>
<p>Mary Rodwell （*1) も同様の証言をしている。</p>
<p>Chris Bledsoe（*3）も同様の体験。</p>
<p>21:20 ある abductee の事例。40年前の abduction 体験を Barbara Lamb  が退行催眠で調査した時、abductee に ET に質問することを求めた。すると ET が Barbara Lamb と話したいと告げた。</p>

<p>しかし、ここで紹介したいのは...これは、時間と空間があるという考え方だ。私は数ヶ月前まで、この概念を本当に理解していなかった。私はカリフォルニアにいて、バーバラ・ラムと話していた。バーバラ・ラムは、退行療法を行うUFO分野の主要人物の一人だ。自分の経験が宇宙船でのものだったと信じる人々だ。
(0:18:41)</p>
<p>バーバラは、体験者たちと彼女がやっていることについて、体験者たちが宇宙船に乗っているとき、それが初めての遭遇だとすると、彼らはとても怯えていると話していた。彼らは何が起こっているのかわからない。
彼らの周りを何かが動き回っているとか、とにかく。そこでバーバラは、自分が何をすべきかを決めた。それは、回帰セッションで彼らがパニックを起こすのをただ見ているのではなく、彼らを落ち着かせようとすることだった。
（0:19:05）</p>
<p>そこで彼女は彼らに何を言うかというと、彼らを気晴らしさせようとする。彼女は彼らに言う。「私は怖い」と。すると彼女は「彼らがあなたに何をしているか知っている？」と聞く。するとその人は「いいえ、彼らが私に何をしているか知りません」と言う。
（0:19:24）</p>
<p>そして彼女は言うだろう。「なぜ尋ねなかったの？」と。そして長い沈黙の後、その人は言うだろう。「彼らは私の腎臓を見ていると言う。医者に診てもらった方がいいと言う。腎臓に何か問題がある。医者に診てもらわなきゃ。」そして彼女は言うだろう。「いいわ、右側を見て。あなたの隣に誰が立っている？その存在を説明しなさい。
（0:19:39）</p>
<p>そして、彼女は彼らが経験している恐怖から注意をそらして、船内を見回したり、物事を描写したりするように仕向けるのだ。このことの鍵となるのは、その出来事が最初に起こったときには、そのようなことは何も起こらなかったという事実だ。つまり、バーバラ・ラムが実際にやったことは、過去に戻って起こった出来事のひとつを変更したということだ。
(0:20:07)</p>
<p>なぜなら、最初の時は腎臓について尋ねなかったし、部屋を見回すこともなかった。何もしていなかったのだ。だから、基本的に、過去の出来事は石に刻み込まれていると思うだろう。過去に起こったことは変えられない。これはバーバラがいつもやっていることなので、はっきりと示されている。
(0:20:21)</p>
<p>そして、私はオーストラリアのメアリー・ロッドウェルにも同じ質問をしたと思う。そして、私は「あなたも同じことを発見した？」と尋ねた。彼女は「はい」と答えた。つまり、過去の出来事に入り込んで、実際にその出来事を変えることができるという状況があるということだ。そして、彼女が話しているもう一つのことは、時間の概念だ。
(0:20:35)</p>
<hr>
<p>そして、空間の概念もある。バーバラはバーバラとの会話の中で、メアリー・ロッドウェルに尋ねたところ、メアリー・ロッドウェルも同じようなことが起こったと言っていた。退行中に、その人に宇宙人にこれを尋ねて、あれを尋ねてほしいと頼むと。クリス・ブレッドソーの場合も同じことが起こった。クリス・ブレッドソーの経験をご存知なら、記録を見れば分かるが、基本的に彼は宇宙人にあらゆる質問をしていた。
（0:21:00）</p>
<p>退行は彼にこれを尋ね、彼にそれを尋ねた。そして、彼は存在者に質問をしていた。それで、バーバラ・ラムは私に、彼女はこれらの体験者に話しかけるだろうと言った。そして、彼らは基本的に、こう言った。ああ、これは起こっている、それは起こっている。突然、ある人が、ああ、彼らはあなたと話したいと言っていると言った。
（0:21:25）</p>
<p>すると彼女は、その存在と実際に会話を始めた。これは40年前に起こった出来事かもしれないが、突然その存在がバーバラと話したがったのだ。バーバラが私にその話をしたとき、その話には空間的な考え方が含まれていたのだが、突然、私にはその意味が理解できた。彼女は、その存在が自分に話しかけていると言う。
(0:21:40)</p>
<p>バーバラが何をしているのか、正確には思い出せない。彼女は庭で何か作業をしている。そして、その存在はバーバラが経験した出来事を説明していた。バーバラは「ああ、そこにいたの？」と言った。すると、その存在は「いいや、バーバラ、私はあなたの惑星に行ったことはない」と答えた。
これが全体の考え方だ。
(0:21:58)</p>
<p>それで、彼は、もしかしたら彼らはここにさえいないのかもしれない、もしかしたら彼らは実際に自分自身を投影できるのかもしれない、彼らはこの世界にいながら、実は別の世界にいて、あるいはこの一体性の概念に戻っているのかもしれない、と考えるようになった。すべてはひとつなのだ。彼らはここに旅してくる必要さえない。すべてはひとつなのだ。彼らはただフィールドにアクセスし、何が起こっているかを正確に知ることができる。
(0:22:15)</p>
<p>すべて同じことだからだ。これがこの考え方だ。他のことでも同じことが分かるだろう。ドロレス・キャノンがこのことについて話している。マークを目撃した地元の男が2人いた。後になって、そのうちの1人がリモートビューアーと話した。そのリモートビューアーは、米空軍のリモートビューイングプログラムを運営していたトップクラスのリモートビューアーの1人の下で働いていた人物だ。
(0:22:39)</p>
<p>彼女は彼のためにリーディングを行ったが、彼は尋ねた。「あの宇宙船には誰が乗っていたのか？」彼女は答えた。「いいえ、誰も乗っていません。あなたが宇宙船を送り込んだのです。未来から、未来のあなた自身から、あなた自身を目覚めさせるために送ったのです。だから、こういった類のものを調べ始めると、多くの証拠がある。集め始めると、かなり奇妙なことが起こり、時間や空間が存在せず、未来の人生をさまよい歩けるかもしれないという証拠がたくさん出てくる。
(0:23:06)</p>
<p>そして、それはすべて今、バシャールが言うように、時間について尋ねられたときに、彼はいつもこう言う。時計を見てごらん、今何時？ すると相手は2時半と答える。あなたは違う、違う、今は今だと言う。いつも今なのだ。今しかない。そして、これがUFO現象を理解したいのであれば、こうしたことを理解することから始めなければならないと思う。時間や空間は存在しないかもしれないし、脳が私たちに伝えていることの多くは真実ではないかもしれない。
（0:23:30）</p>
<details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary>▼文字起こし 原文 展開</summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><p>But the one I want to show you here... and this is this idea that we believe there is time and space. I never really understood this concept till a couple of months ago. I was in California. I was talking to Barbara Lam. And Barbara Lam is one of the the key people in the UFO field who regresses. People who believe their experiences have been on board the ship.
(0:18:41)</p><p>And Barbara was telling me the story that what she does with experiencers is that when the experiencers are on board the ship, say it's their first encounter, they're very scared. They don't know what's going on.
There's these beings moving around them or whatever. And so Barbara had determined that what she would do is she would try to calm these people down and rather than just allowing them to sort of freak out in this regression session.
(0:19:05)</p><p>So what she would say to them and she would sort of try to distract them. So she would say to them, you know, they would say, I'm scared. And she'd say, so do you know what they're doing to you? And the person would go, no no I don't know what they're doing to me.
(0:19:24)</p><p>And she'd say, well why didn't you ask? And then she said there'd be a long pause and then the person would say, oh they say they're looking at my kidney. They say I should go to the doctor. Something's wrong with my kidney. I should go to the doctor. And then she'd say, okay, look to the look on the on the right-hand side. Who's standing beside you? Describe the being.
(0:19:39)</p><p>And she would actually sort of like divert their attention away from the fear of the experience that they were having to look around the ship and describe stuff and stuff like that. The key to this whole thing is the fact that when that event first happened, none of that stuff happened. So what Barbara Lam has actually done is she's gone back into the past to an event that took place and she changed the event.
(0:20:07)</p><p>Because the first time around they didn't ask about the kidney. They didn't look around the room. They didn't do any kind of stuff. So it's basically you would think that in the past events are chiseled in stone. You can't change things that happened in the past. This shows very clearly because Barbara does it all the time.
(0:20:21)</p><p>And I believe I asked Mary Rodwell the same question out of Australia. And I said, have you found this as well? And she said yes. So you have the situation where you can go into a past event and actually change the event. And the other thing that she talks, that's the the idea of time.
(0:20:35)</p><hr><p>And then you have the idea of space. So Barbara was in this conversation with Barbara and then she said, and I asked Mary Rodwell, and Mary Rodwell says this happens too, that during the regression she said she would ask the person to ask the alien this, ask him that. And the same thing happened with Chris Bledsoe. During Chris Bledsoe, if you know his experience, the transcript shows that basically he was asking all sorts of questions of the of the beings.
(0:21:00)</p><p>The regression said ask him this, ask him that. And he was asking questions of the being. And so Barbara Lamb told me that she would be talking to these these experiencers and they would basically say, you know, this is happening, that's happening. All of a sudden the one person said, oh, they say they want to talk to you.
(0:21:25)</p><p>And so then she would start an actual conversation with the being. So this is an event that may have happened 40 years before and suddenly the being wants to talk to Barbara. And Barbara was telling me the one story and this had this idea of space when it suddenly made sense to me. She says that the being's talking to her.
(0:21:40)</p><p>And I can't remember exactly what the event that Barbara's doing. She's in the garden working in something, whatever. And the being was describing this event that Barbara had had. And so Barbara said, oh, so were you there? And the being says to her, no, Barbara, I've never been to your planet.
And this is the whole idea.
(0:21:58)</p><p>So he starts to look at, well, maybe they're not even here. Maybe they can actually project themselves. They can be in this world and they're actually in another world or go back to this oneness concept. It's all one. They don't even have to travel here. That is all one thing. They can just tap into the field and know exactly what's going on.
(0:22:15)</p><p>And because it's all the same thing. So this is this idea. And you will see this in other things. Dolores Cannon talks about this. I have this Mark sighting, this local guy who had two sightings. And later when he was talking to, this is a remote viewer, one of the people who worked for one of the top remote viewer guys who had run the U.S. Air Force remote viewing program.
(0:22:39)</p><p>She had done a reading for him and she said, no, that was, he asked, he was asking, well, who was in those ships? She said, no, no, there's nobody in those ships. You sent the ship, you sent the things from the, from the future, from your future self, you sent it to yourself to wake yourself up. So when you start looking at all these kinds of stuff, and there's a lot of this evidence, when you start gathering, there's a lot of evidence that shows that it's, it gets pretty weird, that there really may not be any time and space and that we can move around and pass future lives.
(0:23:06)</p><p>And it's all now, almost like Bashar says, when he's asked about time, he always says, look at your watch, what time is it? And the person will say 2.30 and you say, no, no, it's now. It's always now. There is only now. And this is this whole thing that if you want to understand the UFO phenomena, I think you have to start to understand these kind of things, that there may not be any time and space and that a lot of the stuff that the brain is telling us is not really true.

<p>退行催眠中の abductee に、ET に対して質問をさせることで過去の abduction 体験内容それ自体が（時間を遡って）変化した…そう Grant Cameron は主張してる。</p>
<p>同様の主張は遠隔視でもなされている。下の過去記事でも取り上げた。</p>

<p>Grant Cameron は Barbara Lamb や Mary Rodwell の証言を元にタイトルの主張をしているが、ほぼ間違いなく彼らの認識は間違っている。</p>
<p>つまり、Barbara Lamb や Mary Rodwell が退行催眠中に投げかけた質問によって</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>(a) 過去の出来事が実際に変化した…のではなく、</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(b) 以前には無かった ET の反応という「偽の記憶」を生じさせた</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>のだろう。</p>
<p>タイトルの件は、 Barbara Lamb や Mary Rodwell らの実施する退行催眠の信憑性に重大な疑問を引き起こすに十分。その Mary Rodwell が FREE の共同設立者なので （Grant Cameron が事あるごとに言及している）FREE の主張する大規模アンケート調査結果（例：大多数にとって abduction 体験は望ましいものだ…の類）なるものを私は信用しない。</p>

<p>さて、メアリー・ロッドウェルについてあなたが言ったことについてコメントしたい。私はメアリー・ロッドウェルとの退行を行った。そう、リアルタイムで、そう言えるならね。
（2:07:37）</p>
<p>そして、彼女は私が退行中に見た存在に質問することを可能にしてくれた。だから彼女はそのテクニックを使っている。
ええ、それは私にとって独特なことだ。メアリーがこの話を私にするまで理解できなかったが、突然、ピンと来た。この話をいつも耳にしているから、時間と空間がないんだ。アインシュタイン、つまり、光速を移動すると時間が遅くなる、そういうことだ。
(2:08:06)</p>
<p>その概念を理解したことは一度もなかった。彼女がその概念を説明してくれて初めて、おや、君は出来事を変えたんだなと思った。ただ、そういうことなんだと、
(2:08:26)</p>
<p>そして、もしそれが可能であるなら、宇宙人もおそらく他のすべてのことでも可能であるだろう。つまり、ここにあるのは今だけだ。
(2:08:33)</p>
<hr>
<p>そして、私たちが持っているのは、私たちを混乱させるような幻想だ。私たちは、過去、現在、未来があると思っている。そして、私たちが得ている考えは、すべてひとつだ。今、ここにあるのはひとつだけだ。
そして、過去と未来を変えることができる。心理学者もいる。名前が出てこないが、
彼女は、コロンビア大学で博士号を取得した人物で、過去、現在、未来の人生と実際に会議を行い、それらの人生すべてと話し合い、議論を行うことができると主張している。
（2:09:06）</p>
<p>そういう奇妙な話は、あなたに起こったことやバーバラ・ラムが私に話したことを聞くと、より理解できる。そして、あなたは突然気づく。ああ、彼女は固定された出来事ではない、ノミと石の出来事を変えたんだ、と。
実際にイベントに戻って、宇宙人に質問したり、いろいろと話すことができる。奇妙なことだ。つい最近まで、まったく気づかなかった。

I'm just going to comment on something you said about Mary Rodwell. I had a regression with Mary Rodwell. And yes, it was in real time, if you can say that.
(2:07:37)</p><p>And she did kind of make it possible to ask these questions to the beings I saw in my regression. So she does use that technique.
Yeah, that's kind of unique to me. I didn't understand until Mary was telling me this story, and then suddenly it hit me. Because you always hear this story, there's no time and space, you know, Einstein, you know, with the, with, you know, moving the speed of light and the time slows down, all this kind of stuff.
(2:08:06)</p><p>And I never really understood the concept. It wasn't until she told me that concept where I'm thinking, whoa, you changed the event. I just, it just sort of occurred. And I've been doing this like for 44 years.
I didn't realize this, this idea that you can actually prove that you can change, you can change time, you can go back into a past event and actually change that event.
(2:08:26)</p><p>And if you can do it in that, maybe the aliens can actually do it in everything else as well, that there is only here and now.
(2:08:33)</p><hr><p>And that we have the, it's the illusions that are sort of throwing us off. We think there's, there's past, present and future. And the idea we're getting, it's all one. There's only one, one now.
And that you can change the past and the future. There's even a, there's even a psychologist, I can't, her name is escaping me.
She's got a PhD from Columbia who actually talked about the fact that she claims that she can actually have a meeting with her past, present and future lives in a meeting and have a, have a, have a discussion with all these, all her different lives, all talking with each other.
(2:09:06)</p><p>It's just that kind of bizarre stuff makes more sense when you hear what, what happened to you or what, what Barbara Lamb told me, where you suddenly realize, oh, she changed the event where it's not a stationary event, chisels and stone.
You can actually go back and ask questions in your event and talk to the aliens and ask them questions and stuff like that. It's bizarre. I just, I never picked it up until that, until just a couple months ago.

<li>
<p>見事、ゲームクリアすると、これまでの人生のステージを終え、別のステージに進む。これが彼の輪廻仮説。</p>

</ul></blockquote>
<p>と述べるが、それは早合点でしかない。なぜなら、</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>一旦、ある人物（A）が人生において成功なり危機回避したとしても、</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A の周囲の関係者の誰かも同様に、成功するまでゲームを繰り返しているから、A のゲーム・クリアはその関係者によってリセットされてしまう。</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>全ての関係者が同時にゲーム・クリアされる可能性はほぼゼロ。なぜなら、それらの関係者にも複数の関係者がおり、その関係者のネットワークは結果的には全国民や主要国の国民を巻き込むことになるゆえ。</p>

<p>では、</p>
<ul>
<li>A の周囲の関係者の誰かも同様に、成功するまでゲームを繰り返しているから、A のゲーム・クリアはその関係者によってリセットされてしまう。</li>

<p>確かに矛盾は回避できる。だが、独我論を採用した時点で</p>
<blockquote><ul>

<li>他の全ての人類のようなロボット的存在ではなく意識を備えた特別な存在</li>
</ul>
<p>であることが前提になっている。その特別な存在が、ロボット的存在と同じような境遇で生活することはありえない。皇帝や独裁者、大統領が平民と全く同じ生活をするようなもの。平民と同じ生活をすれば、それは平民でしかない。</p>

<p>遠隔視で UFO の中を観察したという事例は、どれも変性意識状態における無意識の創作だと私は判断している。つまり夢で見た光景と同じく現実ではない。</p>
<p>ごくごく稀に偶然では説明不能の正夢を見ることがあるように、遠隔視も当たることがあるだろうが、それは例外的な事例。大量のハズレ馬券（＝無意識的創作）の中に数枚の当り馬券が混じっているようなもの。</p>

<p>この件は別の意味で重要。このインタビューで、John Alexander は</p>

<li>Joe McMoneagle が UFO の中を遠隔視 → ET が遠隔視されていることを認識</li>

<p>そして興味深い話がある。ご存知のように、Remote Viewers 001のジョー・マクモニーグルだ。そう、ドリームランドで彼のインタビューがあるんだ。ごめんなさい?
ウェブサイトに彼のインタビューがあるんだ。そうなんだ。彼はスクーターと結婚していて、ボブ・モンローの娘なんだ。
SRIでUFOのリモート・ビューイングをしているときに、突然、彼らが自分の存在に気づいていることに気づいたんだ。

<p>And there's an interesting tale, as you know, Joe McMoneagle with Remote Viewers 001. Yeah, we have an interview with him on Dreamland. I'm sorry?
We have an interview with him on the website. Yes. Yeah, well, he is also married to Scooter, who is Bob Monroe's daughter.
But he told us a story about when he's working out at SRI and doing remote viewing a UFO and saying, all of a sudden, he becomes aware that they are aware of his presence, you know, and just consciousness being forward.

<p>それで、『懐疑論者の手引き』にカーター大統領を登場させることになったわけだが、ジェイは視聴者の関心を引くために、毎回エピソードの最後に質問を用意していた。その質問のひとつが、「UFO信者を笑いものにしていた元世界指導者が、UFOを目撃して自らも信者になった。それについて考えて、最初に正解した人になろう。
(0:47:50)</p>
<p>皆さん、頑張って。
(0:47:52)</p>
<hr>
<p>そして僕は、彼が誰のことを言っているのかよく分かる。それで、懐疑論者のガイドにメールしたんだ。ジミー・カーター大統領の孫だという男からメールが来た。
それでね、ちょっと懐疑的だったんだ。
スティーブは私にメールを返してきて、あなたの話を信じます、あなたの言うことも信じます、でも何か証拠はあるんですか？ジミー・カーターの孫だという証拠はあるのか？それで私は、私と妻と祖父母が隣に座っている私の結婚式の写真を送った。私が誰であるか、私が誰であるかを言っている、かなり決定的な証拠だ。
(0:48:25)</p>
<p>それで、ジョシュを番組に呼んで、カーター大統領のUFO目撃談を話してもらった。
でも、代わりに私の祖父の話を聞きたい？彼は「うん」と言った。
ごめん、君よりおじいちゃんと話したいんだ。悪気はないんだ。それで私は祖父に電話し、懐疑論者のガイドに出演してもらえないかと頼んだ。彼はいいよと言った。
(0:48:45)</p>
<p>2007年、ポッドキャストのエピソード105で、ジミー・カーター大統領に登場してもらい、彼の話を聞いた。
当時、私は56のライオンズクラブの地区ガバナーだった。私は奉仕の年にそれぞれのクラブを訪問しなければならなかった。ある晩、私はサウス・ジョージア州の小さな町にいて、校舎の外で夕食を食べたり、話をするのを待っていた。
(0:49:15)</p>
<p>そして私たち全員、私の記憶が正しければ、確か26人の男たちが、西の空にとても明るい光を見た。
星よりもずっと明るかった。
それはだんだん近づいてきて、私たちの近くで止まったように見えた。</p>
<p>(0:49:42)</p>
<p>そしてしばらくそこにとどまった。私たちは皆、自分たちが見ているものが何なのかわからず、愕然とした。そしてその光は、固形物ではなく、ただそれだけが見えた。光はゆっくりと、それが来た方向へと消えていった。私は科学者であり、地球外生命体が宇宙から来た船に乗っているなどとは考えたこともなかったが、それは未確認飛行物体だった。
(0:50:16)</p>
<p>明らかに未確認で、飛んでいて、物体だった。それがいわゆるUFOに関する私の経験の限界だった。それで、彼はその話をし、とにかく数年間はそれで終わった。一方、ジョージア工科大学のジェリー・ジャスティスという教授がいる。ジョージア出身の私はジョージアの歴史に興味があり、ある日、ドン・ロジェの『ジョージアの神話と伝説』という本を読んでいた。そこには、カーターがUFOを目撃したという記述があり、彼の実際のUFOレポートのレプリカも掲載されている。
(0:50:55)</p>
<p>そして、その記述の詳細を読んだとき、誰かがバリウム放出雲を見たと記述しているのとそっくりだと言った。大学院に入ったとき、サポートが必要だったので、空軍のプロジェクトで研究助手の仕事を得た。そのひとつが、エグリン空軍基地からのロケット発射だった。そのロケットは何をしていたのか？バリウムを放出するロケットは、言うなれば、バリウム化学薬品の入った容器を大気圏のある地点で放出するんだ。高度では太陽光が当たるが、地表は暗い。
(0:51:39)</p>
<p>だから、バリウム物質が放出されて光っている写真を撮ることができた。バリウム自体は太陽光の下にあり、あなたはそれを黒い空を背景に見ている。その通りだ。ある日突然、ジェリー・ジャスティスという男からメールが届いた。彼はジョージア工科大学の教授だ。君のおじいさんのUFOの話がわかったよ。
(0:52:00)</p>
<p>太陽光はバリウムの一部を実際にイオン化するのに十分な強さだろう。
(0:52:04)</p>
<hr>
<p>そして中性のバリウムは緑がかった青っぽい色に見えるだろう。イオン化したバリウムは赤みがかった色になり、地球の磁場に沿って伸びる。このような高度での地球の磁場の特徴を調べることも研究の一環だった。空軍は当時、絶対に観測ロケットを打ち上げていた。
(0:52:35)</p>
<p>たとえば、電波の反射率や軍事作戦の他の側面をテストするために、大気中に投棄するさまざまなものが入っていただろう。だから、人が上空であのような雲を見たとしても、珍しいことでも奇妙なことでもない。最初は小さな小さな光の点として輝き、太陽の当たり方やバリウムの電離の仕方によって赤や青に変化する巨大な球体に膨張し、やがて消滅する。
(0:53:01)</p>
<p>私は、わあ、これは私の祖父のUFOについてずっと聞いてきた話にそっくりだ、と思った。それで、あなたはそれを伝えて、大統領はどう思ったの？彼は興奮していたよ。彼は答えが出たことに興奮していたし、未確認から識別に移ったことにとても満足していた。彼はそれが何なのか知りたがった。というのも、祖父がその話をしたとき、多くの人は祖父が金星を見たのだと思ったからだ。彼は空を見て育った。天文学に興味を持って育った。彼は海軍士官として育った。
(0:53:30)</p>
<p>彼は金星がどのように見えるかを知っていたので、金星が何であるかを知らないと思われることに腹を立てていた。ジャスティス教授は、カーター大統領がライオンズクラブの外にいた正確な日時の打ち上げを探し出し、カーター大統領の方角と高度に関する推定がほぼ正確に当たっていたことを突き止めた。
(0:53:57)</p>
<p>さて、私の最初の調査結果をカーター・センターに送ったところ、カーター大統領にそれを伝えて分析してもらったという返事が返ってきた。
そうして、大統領自身が満足するように、彼のUFOはかなり異国的な空中散乱物であり、人工的なバリウム雲であったことが判明した。

<details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary>▼文字起こし 原文展開</summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><p>So, how did we come to have President Carter on the Skeptics' Guide So, Jay would have a question at the end of every episode that would, you know, for audience engagement. He would ask a question about any given topic, and one of the questions that he he asked was, Name the former world leader that used to laugh at UFO believers, but later became a believer himself when he himself witnessed one. Think about that and be the first one to answer correctly.
(0:47:50)</p><p>Good luck, everyone.
(0:47:52)</p><hr><p>And I was like, man, I know exactly who he's talking about. So, I emailed the Skeptics' Guide. We got an email from a guy, you know, who claimed to be President Jimmy Carter's grandson.
And, you know, I have to say that I was a little bit skeptical.
So, Steve emailed me back, and he was like, okay, we believe your story, and we believe what you said, but do you have any proof? What proof can you give us that you're Jimmy Carter's grandson? And so, I sent him my wedding photo with me, my wife, and my grandparents sitting next to me. Pretty definitive proof that I am saying who I am, who I say.
(0:48:25)</p><p>So, I invited Josh to come on the show and tell us the story of President Carter's UFO sighting.
I said, well, I could, but would you like to talk to my grandfather instead? He was like, yes.
Sorry, I'd rather talk to your grandfather than you. No offense. So, I called my grandfather and I asked if he would be on the Skeptics' Guide. He said, sure.
(0:48:45)</p><p>So, in 2007, episode 105 of our podcast, we had on President Jimmy Carter, and he told us his story.
Well, back in those days, I was the district governor of 56 Lions Clubs. I had to visit each one of those clubs during my year of service. And I was in a small South Georgia town one night outside the schoolhouse waiting to eat supper and to talk to them.
(0:49:15)</p><p>And all of us, there were 26 men, I believe, if I remember right, all of us saw a very bright light in the western sky.
And it was bright enough to attract our attention, much brighter than a star.
And it got closer and closer, and then it seemed to stop in its proximity to us. And then the color of it changed from white to blue to red.
(0:49:42)</p><p>And it stayed there for a while. All of us were aghast at what we were seeing, couldn't figure it out. And then the light, that's all we could see, not a solid object, the light then slowly disappeared back into the direction from which it came. So, I'm a scientist by training, and I have never thought there were extraterrestrial beings on a ship from outer space or anything, but it was an unidentified flying object.
(0:50:16)</p><p>It was obviously unidentified, it was flying, and it was an object. And so, that's the limit of my experience with so-called UFOs. So, he told that story, and for several years anyway, that was the end of it. Meanwhile, there's this professor from Georgia Tech, Jerry Justice. Well, as a native Georgian, I've always been interested in Georgia history and was one day reading the book by Don Roge, Georgia Myths and Legends. And it gives an account of Carter seeing the UFO, and includes a replica of his actual UFO report.
(0:50:55)</p><p>And when I read the details of that description, I said, that sounds exactly like someone describing seeing a barium release cloud. When I started graduate school, I needed some support, so I got a job as a research assistant on an Air Force project. One of the things involved was rocket launches from Eglin Air Force Base. So, what were these rockets doing? Well, the rockets that released the barium would take up a canister, if you will, of barium chemical and release it out at a point in the atmosphere. And this would be in sunlight at altitude, but dark on the surface.
(0:51:39)</p><p>So, you could get good pictures of this glowing release of barium material. So, the barium itself was in sunlight and you're viewing it against a black sky. That's correct. So, one day out of the blue, I get an email from this guy, Jerry Justice. He is a Georgia Tech professor. And he just sends me an email and says, hey, I think I figured out your grandfather's UFO story.
(0:52:00)</p><p>The sunlight would be strong enough to actually ionize part of the barium.
(0:52:04)</p><hr><p>And the neutral barium would look greenish, bluish color. The ionized barium would look a sort of reddish color and would stretch out along the field lines of the Earth's magnetic field. And so, this was part of the studies is to determine characteristics of the Earth's magnetic field at those altitudes. The Air Force was absolutely launching sounding rockets during that time and continues to this day for a variety of purposes.
(0:52:35)</p><p>They would have had different things in them that they would have dumped in the atmosphere, for example, to test radio reflectability and other aspects of military operations. So, it's not unusual or odd at all that a person could have seen a cloud like that in the sky. As it starts out as a small little point of light that glows and it expands into a big giant orb that turns red or blue depending on how the sun hits it and how the barium gets ionized and then it dissipates.
(0:53:01)</p><p>And I was like, wow, that sounds exactly like the story that I've heard my entire life about my grandfather's UFO. So, did you pass that on and what did the president think of that? He was excited about it. He was excited to have an answer and moving from unidentified to identified, very satisfactory for him. He wanted to know what it was. Because when my grandfather told that story, a lot of people assumed that he saw Venus. He grew up looking at the sky. He grew up interested in astronomy. He grew up as a naval officer.
(0:53:30)</p><p>He knew what Venus looked like and he was offended that people thought that he didn't know what Venus was. Professor Justice tracked down the exact launch on the right day and time that President Carter had been outside the Lions Club and found that Carter's estimates of direction and elevation had been almost exactly right on the money.
(0:53:57)</p><p>Well, my initial findings I sent to the Carter Center and heard back from them that they had passed it along to President Carter for his analysis and he basically concurred that it was plausible that that was indeed what he had seen.
And so, to the president's own satisfaction, it turns out that his UFO was a fairly exotic piece of airborne clutter, an artificial barium cloud.

<p>つまり、あなたは、これは何だと思う？これについて何か推測していることはある？もう少し話を聞いてみたい。これは何だと思う？これはボールなのか？ボール・ライトニングではないだろう？自然現象か？そうは思わないね。
(0:10:35)</p>
<p>でも、こういうのってどれくらい続くんだろう？ボール・ライトニングは短時間のものだろう？この光の玉はどのくらい続くのだろう？
(0:10:39)</p>
<hr>
<p>数分間続くこともあるし、加速して遠ざかることもある。だから、ほんの数秒の出来事ではないんだ。このような状況は一年中あり、報告も寄せられるが、UFOは、これから具体的に話すように、奇妙な光の球体である。
(0:11:03)</p>
<p>天候に恵まれず、嵐もなく、明確な活動もなく、この種のものが出現する条件はない。そしてまた、これらの天体のいくつかは単なる光源ではなく、より強固で金属的に見えるケースもある。今年の4月、4月6日にも実に興味深いものがある。これはフェイエット郡で起きたもので、ジム・ブラウンが調査した。彼は事件発生から45分以内に現場に到着した。
(0:11:29)</p>
<p>ある男性とその妻が外にいて、これは午後3時ごろに起こった。彼らは畑に出て、一輪車を持って、表土を掘り、地面に穴を埋めていた。
(0:11:53)</p>
<p>そして、フェンスラインから10フィートほどしか離れていないその物体が、ゆっくりと彼らに近づいてくるのを見た。それがだんだん近づいてくるにつれて、彼らはこれが気球ではないことに気づく。しかし、かなり近づくにつれ、爆発したようだと彼らは言った。
(0:12:11)</p>
<p>そしてその物体から地面に小さな稲妻のようなものが放たれたという。小さな爆竹のような爆発音がして、火花のような音がした。火花は畑に小さな火をつけ、すぐに消し止めた。そして、その物体の通り道に沿って100フィートほど離れたところが、彼らに向かって移動していることに気づいた。それはまた別の小さな火で、彼らはそれを消しに行った。信じられないことだ。
(0:12:35)</p>
<p>すごいことだ。
彼らは唖然としていた。しかしジムは45分以内に現場に到着した。残留物も残骸も全くない。爆竹かマイラー風船が爆発したのなら、そこらじゅうに残留物があるはずだ。現場には何もなかった。
目撃者にはこれが固形物に見えたのだろうか？それとも光の現象のように見えたのだろうか？
(0:12:56)</p>
<p>私の理解では、それは銀色で円形で、固形物のように見えた。そして、彼らがそれを見ているうちに、物理的に輝度が増していった。
でもその後、爆発したように見えた。
そう、そしてそれは僕にとっても非常に珍しいものだった。
火を噴いたんだ。火事になった。
数年前にも、そこから数キロ離れた場所で起きたんだ。
(0:13:24)</p>
<p>もちろん目撃者も違う。しかしこれは2019年の11月のことだった。メイソンタウンの近くだった。430年ごろのある男性が、自宅へ向かうために道路を走っていると、目の前に直径2フィートほどの球状の物体が地面に落ちているのが見えた。
(0:13:52)</p>
<p>そして彼は気づいた、そうか、これが何であれ、大きなボールのようだ。それなら外に出て、これを動かさないといけない。彼が車のドアを開け、突然それに向かって動き出すと、その物体は突然消え始め、消え去り、彼がそこにたどり着く前に消えてしまった。
(0:14:11)</p>
<p>信じられないような話だ。長年の研究で、このような話をいくつも読んだことを思い出す。一般的なUFOレポートを読んでいると、時折このような球体のレポートに出くわすことがある。
(0:14:24)</p>
<hr>
<p>僕が一番読んだ記憶があるのは、くすんだオレンジ色のようなものだった。おそらく世界中にあると思う。アメリカにもいる。確か70年代だったと思うけど、カリフォルニアのハイウェイを走っている人の写真を何度か読んだ記憶がある。</p>

<details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary>▼文字起こし 原文 展開</summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><p>And, I mean, what do you, what do you think this is? Can I ask you what you're, have you speculated about this? I'd like to hear some more of these stories. But what do you think is, what is this? Is this a ball? This can't be ball lightning, can it? Like a natural phenomenon? I wouldn't think so.
(0:10:35)</p><p>But how long do these things last? Ball lightning is a brief kind of a thing, isn't it? How long do these, do these balls of light last for?
(0:10:39)</p><hr><p>Well, sometimes it's for several minutes, so they move away, or sometimes they accelerate, or they go up into the sky, or they go off into the woods and just keep going. So it's not something that takes place just for a few seconds. And, and these types of conditions, we're having them in, again, all year round, reports come in, but UFOs, like we'll talk about specifically right now, these strange spheres of light.
(0:11:03)</p><p>We don't have the weather conditions, there's no storms, there's clear activity, there's no conditions for this type of thing. And again, some of these objects appear not to be just light sources, but there's some cases where they appear to be more solid and metallic. But here's another really interesting one, April of this year, April 6th. And this, and it's up in Fayette County, and Jim Brown investigated. And he got on the scene of this case within 45 minutes after it happened.
(0:11:29)</p><p>So it's, it's a nice day, a man and his wife are outside, this occurred around three o'clock in the afternoon, they're out in their field, they have their wheelbarrow, they're digging some topsoil, filling some holes in the ground, when suddenly they see about 50 feet away, what they thought at first was a mylar balloon, they see the silver circle object about two feet in diameter.
(0:11:53)</p><p>And they watch this thing, it's only about 10 feet above the fence line, slowly moving towards them. And as it gets closer and closer, they realize this is not a balloon, this object is now getting physically brighter and brighter as it gets closer. But as it gets quite close to them, they said it like exploded.
(0:12:11)</p><p>And they said there was like a small lightning bolt shot from the object to the ground. It's the explosive sounds like that of a small firecracker followed by a snap like a spark. The spark started a small fire in the field, which they immediately put out. And they noticed that about 100 feet away along the path of the object was moving towards them. It was also another small fire that they went and put out. That's incredible.
(0:12:35)</p><p>That's amazing.
They were stunned. But Jim gets out there within 45 minutes, he gets to the scene. There's no residue or debris at all. Had he had a firecracker or a mylar balloon exploded, there should have been residue everywhere. There was nothing whatsoever at the scene.
Did this thing look like a solid object to the witnesses? Or did it look more like a light phenomenon?
(0:12:56)</p><p>My understanding was that it was silver and circular and looked like a solid object. And it physically got more intense and luminosity as they were looking at it.
But then it seemed to kind of explode, as it were.
Yeah, and then that was a very unusual one for me, too.
It started a fire. It started a fire, no less.
Yeah, and there was another case a few years ago, up in several miles from there.
(0:13:24)</p><p>Of course, different witnesses, too. But this was in November of 2019. And this was near the Mason Town area. And a man around 430, he was riding down the road to get to his home when in front of him, he sees this object about two feet in diameter on the ground, a spherical object on the ground.
(0:13:52)</p><p>And he realizes, well, whatever this thing is, it looks like a big ball. Then I'm going to have to get out there and I'm going to have to move this thing. So as he opens the car door and he starts to suddenly move towards it, the object begins to suddenly fade away, vanish and disappears before he gets to it.
(0:14:11)</p><p>These are incredible stories. I recall reading a number of these in over many years of research. You know, when you're reading about UFO reports in general, every now and then, one would come across these types of reports of these spheres.
(0:14:24)</p><hr><p>The ones that I recall reading the most were like a dull orange color frequently. And they're around, I think they're probably around the world. They're definitely around the United States. I recall reading several of someone driving along a California highway back in, I think, the 70s. That's a long time ago.

<p>Dec 7, 2022  #Bigfoot
Richard Dolan interviews Stan Gordon, one of the most experienced and respected UFO researchers in the world. Stan has spent more than 60 years actively studying UFOs and has operated perhaps the longest-running UFO hotline in the world in Western Pennsylvania. Stan is also a leading researcher of Sasquatch or Bigfoot and is not afraid to discuss potential connections between UFO and Bigfoot sightings. This interview discusses the phenomenon of seemingly intelligent balls of light and then moves into a deep dive into Bigfoot.
