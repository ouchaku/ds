On the afternoon of May 5, 1954, eight-year-old Arnaldo Ribeiro de Freitas was goat-herding near his home in Fregim, Portugal when an odd sound alerted him to two UFOs hovering nearby. One flew off, but the other remained, and Arnaldo could see two big-headed humanoids sitting inside it. And one was looking right at him! After it departed, it left weird landing traces on the ground."}),(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"ANOTHER ALIEN MICHELIN MAN. One afternoon in May of 1960, Professor Miguel Timermans Ceballos was driving his motorcycle near Cadiz, Spain. Looking ahead, he saw a strange humanoid figure which looked very much like the famous Michelin Man. Seconds later, a second figure appeared. Both walked clumsily across the road before disappearing into the brush. Miguel was convinced they were not human."}),(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"IT WASN\u2019T ANYTHING HUMAN. Late in the evening of October 23, 1963, Robert W. Smith drove in a rural area of South River, NJ when he saw something odd in the beams of his car headlights: three very short humanoid figures dressed in tight-fitting, silver, one-piece suits. They darted across the road far faster than a human could move. Robert was too frightened to stop. It was an experience he would never forget."}),(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"THE FLOATING HUMANOID OF COFICO. On July 2, 1968, numerous residents of Cofico, Argentina observed UFOs and/or humanoids hovering overhead. Three witnesses at one home described a glowing humanoid figure floating in the air.

In early May of 1969, numerous residents in Rockville, Virginia started seeing UFOs darting around overhead. But on the night of May 11, 1969, Mike Luczkowich saw actual humanoids. Driving along Route 622, he saw what he first thought were two deer. Instead, he realized they were four-foot-tall humanoids with giant heads. They crossed the road in front of him, followed by a third one."}),(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"THE DUMBBELL ETS. On the night of October 24, 1976, Romeo Lucarelli and his young daughter were driving to their home in Hobling, France when a brilliant light appeared ahead of them.

His wife ran out just in time to see the UFO dart away."}),(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"IT DIDN\u2019T SEEM LIKE A NORMAL PERSON. On the night of January 21, 1977, Juan Pedro Hernandez of Camuy, Puerto Rico was shocked to see an ET craft hovering at low altitude overhead.
